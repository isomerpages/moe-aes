<p>From January 22 to 24, our students embarked on the <strong>REAL</strong> (<strong>R</strong>elevant, <strong>E</strong>ngaging, <strong>A</strong>uthentic <strong>L</strong>earning)
Programme, an initiative named after Brother Real Perreault. Brother Real
was born in Canada on 7 October 1922, and became a Brother of Saint Gabriel
in 1939. He was a kind and approachable person whom everyone loved. Brother
Real devoted 36 years of his life to the service of Boys’ Town.</p>
<p>The REAL Programme is unique for each level, with every level having a
signature theme that epitomises one of Montfort’s stories. The programme
aims to provide students with a relevant, engaging, and authentic learning
experience.</p>

<p>Our Secondary 1 students marked an exciting milestone with a 3D2N overnight
camp at SAFRA Yishun. Centred around Relevant, Engaging, and Authentic
Learning, the camp was thoughtfully designed to equip students with essential
life skills while fostering school spirit and the values that define our
community. Guided by the theme <em>“Building Bonds, Grit, and Spirit,”</em> students
were immersed in meaningful experiences that encouraged them to form lasting
connections, develop resilience, and grow in confidence as they embraced
their new journey as AssumptionKnights.</p>

<p>Throughout the camp, students were introduced to self-management strategies,
learning to navigate unfamiliar situations and build resilience in the
great outdoors. The carefully-curated activities also encouraged social
awareness and environmental consciousness, helping students understand
their roles as responsible members of a diverse society.</p>

<p>Team bonding activities provided opportunities for students, newly enrolled
in the school, to form meaningful friendships and build trust within their
classes. High-element challenges like rock climbing allowed students to
face fears, boost confidence, and experience the power of teamwork. Water
activities and orienteering promoted problem-solving and leadership as
students worked together to complete tasks in new environments.</p>

<p>Central to the camp was a focus on inclusivity and the embodiment of our
school’s CHRIST values — Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Sense
of Responsibility, and Trust. These values were integrated into every activity,
helping students reflect on their roles as responsible and compassionate
members of the school community.</p>

<p>The camp concluded with a lively campfire night, where each class performed
spirited segments, showcasing their creativity and teamwork. This memorable
finale marked the beginning of their shared journey, strengthening their
connection to the school’s identity and spirit.</p>

<p><strong>RENNES Programme (Sec 2)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the story of Montfort in Rennes (Rooted in Values, Rising
with Purpose), the 2025 Sec 2 REAL Programme offered students three days
of immersive, values-driven learning. Designed to nurture both heart and
mind, the programme provided a platform for students to grow in character,
strengthen connections, and explore the world around them with curiosity
and courage.</p>
<p><strong>Paddling Forward Together: Dragon Boating at Marina Reservoir</strong>
<br>The adventure began on water, as students took on the challenge of dragon
boating at Marina Reservoir. More than just a sport, this experience was
a test of communication, trust, and perseverance. As they rowed in unison
under the sun, our AssumptionKnights learnt what it truly means to move
forward together. Through every splash and stroke, they built camaraderie,
resilience, and a spirit of mutual encouragement. These are hallmarks of
fortitude in action.</p>
<p><strong>Artefactually Speaking: A Journey Through Time at the National Museum</strong>
<br>At the National Museum of Singapore, students stepped into the shoes of
historians, exploring 700 years of Singapore’s past through artefacts and
interactive exhibits. With guidance from Museum Educators and a special
"Passport" activity booklet in hand, students engaged in collaborative
learning that deepened their historical awareness and critical thinking.
As they uncovered stories of human connection, identity, and progress,
they also reflected on the values of respect, responsibility, and the importance
of knowing one’s roots.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Around the World: Exploring Global Cultures at the Science Centre</strong>
<br>The final stop brought students to the Science Centre’s “Mickey Around
the World” exhibition. Designed in an Amazing Race format, the activity
sparked excitement and inquiry as students raced to solve challenges rooted
in global cultures and science concepts. Working together to complete tasks,
they demonstrated mastery by adapting quickly, thinking critically, and
drawing on each other's strengths.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Living Out the CHRIST Values</strong>
<br>Through every moment of the REAL experience, students were called to live
out the school’s core values of Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity,
Sense of Responsibility, and Trust. Whether paddling as one, exploring
history, or racing through scientific challenges, they were reminded that
education is not just about knowledge. It is about becoming a person of
character, one choice at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Learning with Joy, Leading with Purpose</strong>
<br>As our AssumptionKnights continue their journey of self-discovery, the
2025 REAL Programme marked a memorable chapter in their growth. With every
challenge embraced and every insight gained, they took meaningful steps
towards becoming young persons of Fortitude, Mastery, and Charity. With
laughter, learning, and leadership at every turn, the programme exemplified
holistic education in action—where character is formed, bonds are strengthened,
and purpose begins to take shape.</p>
