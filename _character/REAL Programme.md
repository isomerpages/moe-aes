<p>From January 22 to 24, our students embarked on the <strong>REAL</strong> (<strong>R</strong>elevant, <strong>E</strong>ngaging, <strong>A</strong>uthentic <strong>L</strong>earning)
Programme, an initiative named after Brother Real Perreault. Brother Real
was born in Canada on 7 October 1922, and became a Brother of Saint Gabriel
in 1939. He was a kind and approachable person whom everyone loved. Brother
Real devoted 36 years of his life to the service of Boys’ Town.</p>
<p>The REAL Programme is unique for each level, with every level having a
signature theme that epitomises one of Montfort’s stories. The programme
aims to provide students with a relevant, engaging, and authentic learning
experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DINAN Programme (Sec 1)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>Our Secondary 1 students marked an exciting milestone with a 3D2N overnight
camp at SAFRA Yishun. Centred around Relevant, Engaging, and Authentic
Learning, the camp was thoughtfully designed to equip students with essential
life skills while fostering school spirit and the values that define our
community. Guided by the theme <em>“Building Bonds, Grit, and Spirit,”</em> students
were immersed in meaningful experiences that encouraged them to form lasting
connections, develop resilience, and grow in confidence as they embraced
their new journey as AssumptionKnights.</p>

</div>
<p>Throughout the camp, students were introduced to self-management strategies,
learning to navigate unfamiliar situations and build resilience in the
great outdoors. The carefully-curated activities also encouraged social
awareness and environmental consciousness, helping students understand
their roles as responsible members of a diverse society.</p>

</div>
<p>Team bonding activities provided opportunities for students, newly enrolled
in the school, to form meaningful friendships and build trust within their
classes. High-element challenges like rock climbing allowed students to
face fears, boost confidence, and experience the power of teamwork. Water
activities and orienteering promoted problem-solving and leadership as
students worked together to complete tasks in new environments.</p>

</div>
<p>Central to the camp was a focus on inclusivity and the embodiment of our
school’s CHRIST values — Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Sense
of Responsibility, and Trust. These values were integrated into every activity,
helping students reflect on their roles as responsible and compassionate
members of the school community.</p>

</div>
<p>The camp concluded with a lively campfire night, where each class performed
spirited segments, showcasing their creativity and teamwork. This memorable
finale marked the beginning of their shared journey, strengthening their
connection to the school’s identity and spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RENNES Programme (Sec 2)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the story of Montfort in Rennes (Rooted in Values, Rising
with Purpose), the 2025 Sec 2 REAL Programme offered students three days
of immersive, values-driven learning. Designed to nurture both heart and
mind, the programme provided a platform for students to grow in character,
strengthen connections, and explore the world around them with curiosity
and courage.</p>
<p><strong>Paddling Forward Together: Dragon Boating at Marina Reservoir</strong>
<br>The adventure began on water, as students took on the challenge of dragon
boating at Marina Reservoir. More than just a sport, this experience was
a test of communication, trust, and perseverance. As they rowed in unison
under the sun, our AssumptionKnights learnt what it truly means to move
forward together. Through every splash and stroke, they built camaraderie,
resilience, and a spirit of mutual encouragement. These are hallmarks of
fortitude in action.</p>
<p><strong>Artefactually Speaking: A Journey Through Time at the National Museum</strong>
<br>At the National Museum of Singapore, students stepped into the shoes of
historians, exploring 700 years of Singapore’s past through artefacts and
interactive exhibits. With guidance from Museum Educators and a special
"Passport" activity booklet in hand, students engaged in collaborative
learning that deepened their historical awareness and critical thinking.
As they uncovered stories of human connection, identity, and progress,
they also reflected on the values of respect, responsibility, and the importance
of knowing one’s roots.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Around the World: Exploring Global Cultures at the Science Centre</strong>
<br>The final stop brought students to the Science Centre’s “Mickey Around
the World” exhibition. Designed in an Amazing Race format, the activity
sparked excitement and inquiry as students raced to solve challenges rooted
in global cultures and science concepts. Working together to complete tasks,
they demonstrated mastery by adapting quickly, thinking critically, and
drawing on each other's strengths.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Living Out the CHRIST Values</strong>
<br>Through every moment of the REAL experience, students were called to live
out the school’s core values of Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity,
Sense of Responsibility, and Trust. Whether paddling as one, exploring
history, or racing through scientific challenges, they were reminded that
education is not just about knowledge. It is about becoming a person of
character, one choice at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Learning with Joy, Leading with Purpose</strong>
<br>As our AssumptionKnights continue their journey of self-discovery, the
2025 REAL Programme marked a memorable chapter in their growth. With every
challenge embraced and every insight gained, they took meaningful steps
towards becoming young persons of Fortitude, Mastery, and Charity. With
laughter, learning, and leadership at every turn, the programme exemplified
holistic education in action—where character is formed, bonds are strengthened,
and purpose begins to take shape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>POITIERS Programme (Sec 3)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sec 3 POITIERSProgramme is inspired by the story of Monfort in Poitiers,
where Montfort displayed deep love and compassion for the unreached and
destitute. In that same spirit, the POITIERS Programme seeks to cultivate
in our students a heart for caring — beginning with those closest to them
and extending outward to the wider community.</p>

</div>
<p>Caring for those within starts by learning to love and embrace the people
we journey with each day. With the formation of new classes this year,
one of the programme’s key objectives was to help our Secondary 3 students
bond with their classmates and build strong, positive relationships. Through
a series of team-building activities and challenges, students were placed
in situations that required collaboration, empathy, and resilience. These
shared experiences not only strengthened their class spirit, but also prepared
them to serve together in the year ahead with love and purpose.</p>

</div>
<p>Beyond caring for those closest to them, the POITIERS Programme also encouraged
students to extend their compassion beyond the school community. As part
of this, students visited the “Dialogue with Time” exhibition at the Science
Centre—an interactive experience guided by seniors aged 60 and above. The
exhibition invited students to explore the aging process, fostering open
conversations about its biological and emotional aspects, as well as the
societal perceptions that often accompany it. With Values-In-Action (VIA)
projects on the horizon, this experience helped students better understand
and empathise with the elderly they will be engaging with later in the
year.</p>
<p>To further support their journey in community service, SG Cares Volunteer
Centre was invited to share ongoing volunteering opportunities. From small
acts of kindness to committing time for larger causes, students were reminded
that every effort counts. These experiences help students live out what
Montfort so passionately believed: “Those whom the world rejects must move
you the most.”</p>

<p>The programme concluded with a class picnic at East Coast Park. Although
wet weather disrupted plans for a full cohort telematch, the rain brought
about its own kind of bonding. Gathered in cosy huts, students laid out
picnic mats, shared food, sang songs, and played games—creating lasting
memories with their new classmates. It was a fitting end to three meaningful
days of learning, growth, and connection—marking not just the close of
the Poitiers Programme, but the beginning of their Upper Secondary journey
together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CESSON Programme (Sec 4 &amp; 5)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CESSON Programme is a cornerstone initiative designed to guide our
Secondary 4 and 5 students as they approach a significant milestone in
their educational journey. Named in honour of the Cesson Bridge in France,
where our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, began his momentous journey
to Paris, the programme symbolises the pivotal transition our students
are about to undertake and a mental reminder to give their all in everything
that they do. Its core objectives are to foster future-readiness, cultivate
self-awareness regarding personal interests and career aspirations, clarify
the various post-secondary education pathways, and equip students with
essential skills for their future endeavours. Through a carefully structured
series of activities, we aim to partner every student to make informed
and confident decisions about their path ahead.</p>

</div>
<p>The programme is packed with activities that build upon one another, starting
with foundational self-discovery and exploration. On the first day, students
engage in personality tests to better understand their strengths and inclinations,
followed by briefings on the Direct School Admission (DSA) and Early Admissions
Exercise (EAE) briefing. The day ends with a practical interview preparation
workshop, laying the groundwork for future applications. The second day
provides invaluable real-world exposure, featuring an engaging career talk
on the cybersecurity industry by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore
(CSA) and one of the programme's key highlights: an industrial visit to
various partner organisations, such as voco Orchard, Singapore Press Holdings
(SPH) and Changi General Hospital (CGH), allowing students to witness firsthand
the dynamics of a professional environment.</p>

</div>
<p>The programme culminates in a highly anticipated mock interview session,
which serves as a practical application of the skills and knowledge acquired
over the previous days. Students dress in professional office wear and
participate in simulated interviews, receiving constructive feedback to
build their confidence and competence. The experience is designed to be
as authentic as possible, preparing them for future scholarship, EAE, or
job interviews. The entire journey is brought to a meaningful close with
the "CESSON Bridge" crossing and debrief session, a final reflection that
reinforces the programme's goal of empowering students to step boldly and
preparedly into the next chapter of their education and career.
