<p>The Student Management Team (SMT) is part of the Student Development Team
(SDT) in AES. On top of managing disciplinary issues, the SMT actively
promotes a positive culture of care in school with the use of Restorative
Practice and seeks to integrate the teaching of pro-social skills in our
day-to-day interaction with the Assumptionknights.</p>
<p>The SMT works closely with the Year Heads, Guidance and Counselling Unit
and the Form Teachers in achieving the best outcome for each Assumptionknight.</p>
<h3>Instilling Self-Discipline in All AssumptionKnights</h3>
<p>One key objective of the SDT is to develop self-disciplined Assumptionknights
who are able to&nbsp;<strong>govern their own behaviour in a sensible manner</strong>.</p>
<h3>Clear Structures and Guidelines</h3>
<p>In order to build a positive culture of care effectively, clear structures
and guidelines are put in place to ensure that there is consistency in
student management work.</p>
<p><strong>Students’ Briefing</strong>
<br>Students are addressed at the start and end of every semester, as a means
to reiterate expectations and rules in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Schools Rules and Code of Conduct</strong>
<br>Students are able to refer to the school rules and code of conduct in
the Student Handbook.</p>
<h3>Positive Culture of Care</h3>
<p>Student management in AES goes beyond conventional discipline work. In
managing students in a culture of care, the primary focus is on helping
students learn from their mistakes in a positive manner. The team recognises
not just the “bad” behaviour, but seeks to also emphasise on the importance
of recognising good behaviour.</p>
<p>The following practices are in place in AES:</p>
<p><strong>Restorative Practice (RP)</strong> 
<br>During the discipline process, RP is employed to ensure that the emphasis
is on educating the student(s) and helping them understand the impact of
their actions, how they can do better in the future and how to restore
relationships with one another. Behavioural correction helps the students
in the long run, and is in line with our objective of building self-disciplined
Assumptionknights.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching of Pro-Social Skills</strong> 
<br>In our daily interactions with Assumptionknights, we aim to impart pro-social
skills to our students at appropriate moments to help them become Men and
Women of Character and Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Class Awards System</strong> 
<br>OBJECTIVES
<br>The Outstanding AssumptionKnight Award honours deserving students who
have exhibited the student outcomes of Fortitude, Mastery and Charity.</p>
<p>AWARDS
<br>• Fortitude Award – to recognise students who have shown perseverance
and resilience
<br>• Mastery Award – to recognise students who have shown excellence in their
academics or CCAs
<br>• Charity Award – to recognise students who have shown empathy and compassion
<br>• Most Improved Award -&nbsp; to recognise students who have exhibited
improvement in learning attitude or trying their best to&nbsp; achieve
the student outcomes of fortitude, mastery and charity.</p>
<p>The Outstanding AssumptionKnight Award is given out once per&nbsp;<strong>semester</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Holistic Education</strong> 
<br>Building student’s character goes beyond classroom teaching. Recognising
the different learning styles and needs of our students, a student’s Conduct
Grade is not solely dependent on his/her classroom behaviour, but also
focusses on their performance in their CCA(s).</p>
