The Student Management Team (SMT) is part of the Student Development Team (SDT) in AES. On top of managing disciplinary issues, the SMT actively promotes a positive culture of care in school with the use of Restorative Practice and seeks to integrate the teaching of pro-social skills in our day-to-day interaction with the Assumptionknights.

  

The SMT works closely with the Year Heads, Guidance and Counselling Unit and the Form Teachers in achieving the best outcome for each Assumptionknight.

###   Instilling Self-Discipline in All AssumptionKnights

  

One key objective of the SDT is to develop self-disciplined Assumptionknights who are able to&nbsp;**govern their own behaviour in a sensible manner**.

###   Clear Structures and Guidelines

  

In order to build a positive culture of care effectively, clear structures and guidelines are put in place to ensure that there is consistency in student management work.

**Students’ Briefing**

Students are addressed at the start and end of every semester, as a means to reiterate expectations and rules in a timely manner.

**Schools Rules and Code of Conduct**

Students are able to refer to the school rules and code of conduct in the Student Handbook, or here.

###   Positive Culture of Care

  

Student management in AES goes beyond conventional discipline work. In managing students in a culture of care, the primary focus is on helping students learn from their mistakes in a positive manner. The team recognises not just the “bad” behaviour, but seeks to also emphasise on the importance of recognising good behaviour.

  

The following practices are in place in AES:

**Restorative Practice (RP)** <br>
During the discipline process, RP is employed to ensure that the emphasis is on educating the student(s) and helping them understand the impact of their actions, how they can do better in the future and how to restore relationships with one another. Behavioural correction helps the students in the long run, and is in line with our objective of building self-disciplined Assumptionknights.

**Teaching of Pro-Social Skills** <br>
In our daily interactions with Assumptionknights, we aim to impart pro-social skills to our students at appropriate moments to help them become Men and Women of Character and Learning.

**Class Awards System** <br>
OBJECTIVES <br>
The Outstanding AssumptionKnight Award honours deserving students who have exhibited the student outcomes of Fortitude, Mastery and Charity.

  

AWARDS <br>
• Fortitude Award – to recognise students who have shown perseverance and resilience <br>
• Mastery Award – to recognise students who have shown excellence in their academics or CCAs <br>
• Charity Award – to recognise students who have shown empathy and compassion <br>
• Most Improved Award -&nbsp; to recognise students who have exhibited improvement in learning attitude or trying their best to&nbsp; achieve the student outcomes of fortitude, mastery and charity.

  

The Outstanding AssumptionKnight Award is given out once per&nbsp;**semester**.

**Holistic Education** <br>
Building student’s character goes beyond classroom teaching. Recognising the different learning styles and needs of our students, a student’s Conduct Grade is not solely dependent on his/her classroom behaviour, but also focusses on their performance in their CCA(s).
