<h4><strong>Mission Statement</strong></h4>
<p>Assumption English School is committed in ensuring the social, emotional,
spiritual and moral well-being of all our students. To support this commitment,
the Guidance and Counselling Unit provides well-defined and accessible
counselling services.</p>
<h4><strong>The Guidance Unit</strong></h4>
<p>The Guidance Unit consists of School Counsellors, a Special Education
Needs Officer (SENO), a Student Welfare Officer (SWO) and an Education
&amp; Career Guidance (ECG) Counsellor.</p>
<p>School Counsellors help students to manage difficult thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors through individual counselling sessions or group work.</p>
<p>Our Student Welfare Officer provides social support to the students at-risk
under her charge, working with their families and other community partners
to address barriers to learning and strengthening the safety net for these
students.</p>
<p>Our Special Education Needs Officer supports students with mild special
educational needs by providing direct intervention through individual/small
group intervention support or in-class support.</p>
<p>You can schedule an appointment by approaching your form teacher or staff
in the general office for a referral. Alternatively, you can email us directly.</p>
