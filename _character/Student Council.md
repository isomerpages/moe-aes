<h4>Our Purpose</h4>
<p>AES Student Council is formed with the intention of nurturing and empowering
a group of student leaders to represent the voices of the student body
and to take ownership of the school. The long term objectives are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instil in AssumptionKnights a stronger sense of ownership and belonging
to the school</p>
</li>

<p>Create a vibrant and cohesive school culture that is predominantly student-led
and student-centric</p>

<p>Groom respected leaders who can effectively lead self and others and are
exemplars of the CHRIST values</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Leadership Framework</h4>
<p>We adopt the five practices of exemplary leadership under the ‘Leadership
Challenge’ model by James Kouzes and Barry Posner. We aspire to cultivate
student leaders who embody these five core leadership practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model the Way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage the Heart</p>
</li>

<p>Inspire a Shared Vision</p>
