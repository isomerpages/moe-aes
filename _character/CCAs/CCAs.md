<p>At Assumption English School (AES), Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play
a vital role in nurturing well-rounded individuals. All students are strongly
encouraged to commit to a CCA throughout their four years in the school.
This sustained involvement allows them to explore their interests, develop
their talents, and grow in character beyond the academic curriculum. AES
offers a diverse range of CCAs, including Sports, Performing Arts and Uniformed
Groups. Each CCA provides unique opportunities for students to build leadership,
resilience, teamwork, and a sense of responsibility. Through regular training,
performances, competitions, and community involvement, students gain meaningful
experiences that contribute to their personal and social development. The
school believes that consistent participation in CCAs enriches students’
secondary school journey and prepares them for future challenges. At AES,
the CCA journey is more than just an activity—it's an essential part of
developing every student to become the best version of themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students’ CCA involvement is formally recognised through the LEAPS 2.0
framework (link to LEAPS 2.0 site), which records their achievements in
Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation, and Service. This holistic
system encourages students to strive for growth in various domains and
supports their development into confident, values-driven individuals, ready
to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
