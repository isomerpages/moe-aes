<h4>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in AES is also known as Montfortian Achievers’ Programme (MAP)</h4>
<p>The school's Montfortian Achievers Programme (MAP) is a character education
initiative designed to cultivate socially responsible, confident decision-makers.
Grounded in a strong moral compass and CHRIST values, MAP instills the
school's philosophy that education is a journey of self-discovery, guiding
students toward becoming principled citizens.</p>
<p>MAP lessons and assemblies offer students dedicated time to explore life's
meaning and purpose. For instance, during Education and Career Guidance
(ECG) lessons, students learn to clarify their thoughts and weigh diverse
perspectives to make informed decisions about their future paths.</p>
<h4>Importance of Student Voice</h4>
<p>Through these interactions and discussions with peers and teachers on
current events or personal concerns, AssumptionKnights develop understanding,
celebrate similarities, and appreciate differences. These crucial moments
propel them towards our school's vision of "becoming people of character
and learning," enabling them to make decisions for a higher purpose and
ultimately serve the community.

<p>Our lesson packages are built around three interconnected core ideas:
Identity, Relationships, and Choices. These concepts profoundly influence
one another. Students must understand themselves to build positive relationships.
In turn, the relationships they form shape their identity and guide their
decisions. Making sound choices then deepens their self-understanding and
impacts the quality of their relationships.</p>
<p>Assumption English School is dedicated to nurturing well-rounded individuals
by giving equal importance to academic excellence and character development,
preparing our students for lifelong success.</p>
<h4>National Education (NE)</h4>
<p>National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. As a significant aspect
of CCE, NE comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values</strong> to
understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our
nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for
survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be empowering and aspirational, allowing</strong> for individual
sense-making, so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware,
adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional, and global
issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans </strong>and
foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates our
students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and
in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.

<p>
<br>In Assumption English School (AES), AssumptionKnights commemorate the
four NE core events: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial
Harmony Day and National Day. These are the NE events which have been identified
as defining moments in Singapore’s history. The aim is to entrench these
events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive
generation.
