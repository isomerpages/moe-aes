<h3>LEAPS 2.0</h3>
<p><strong><u>MOE LEAPS 2.0 CCA Grading Scheme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through
CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values
and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA
also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration
and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation.</p>
<p><strong><u>LEAPS 2.0</u></strong> 
<br>LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic
development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four
domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.</p>
<p><strong><u>SUPPORTING YOUR CHILD</u></strong> 
<br>As parents, you play an important role in ensuring your child/ward’s holistic
and balanced development. Your child/ward benefits most when the emphasis
on developing values, life skills and your child/ward’s interests and strengths
are reinforced at home. You can discuss the following areas with your child/ward
when selecting his/her co-curricular activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identifying interests and strengths
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Example:&nbsp;<em>What is your child/ward interested in? What is your child/ward good at?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting objectives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Example:&nbsp;<em>What kind of person does your child/ward want to be?</em>
<br>&nbsp;<em>What kind of values and life skills should your child/ward be developed in?</em>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging self-directed learning
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Example:&nbsp;<em>How does your child/ward want to pursue this development?</em> 
<br>&nbsp;<em>What are the possible opportunities that can help support this development?</em>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing commitments
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Example:&nbsp;<em>Is your child/ward able to cope?</em>
<br>&nbsp;<em>How can you help to support him/her in the learning pursuits?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>PARTICIPATION</u></strong> 
<br>This domain recognises students’ participation in one school-based <u>Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that is offered by the school</u>.
Recognition is based on the number of years of participation and exemplary
conduct and active contribution to the CCA. Sustained engagement in the
same CCA allows for progressive development of character, skills, knowledge
and friendships, and will be accorded higher recognition.</p>
<p><strong><u>SERVICE</u></strong> 
<br>This domain recognises students’ development as socially responsible citizens
who contribute meaningfully to the community. Every secondary school student
will contribute at least 6 hours per school year to the community. They
can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action (VIA) project. Students will
be recognised for the time they put into planning, service and reflection,
when participating in a VIA project.</p>
<p><strong><u>LEADERSHIP</u></strong> 
<br>This domain recognises students’ leadership development. Recognition is
accorded to students’ ability to take charge of personal development, work
in a team and assume responsibilities in service of others. In addition
to formal leadership appointments, participation in student leadership
modules/workshops, the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and leadership
positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led projects
will also be recognised.</p>
<p><strong><u>ACHIEVEMENT</u></strong> 
<br>This domain recognises students’ representation and accomplishment in
co-curricular involvements beyond the classroom. Opportunities for representation
and accomplishment present valuable learning experiences for students to
learn discipline, resilience and develop their character. Students may
represent the school or organisations endorsed by the school. Recognising
external opportunities better caters to students’ diverse interests and
talents. It also recognises the community’s role in developing the child.
Representation refers to being selected and endorsed by the school or an
organisation endorsed by the school (e.g. the community club or national
association) to contribute, perform or compete. It need not be tied to
his/her CCA in school. Accomplishment refers to attaining accolades and
awards at competitions, festivals, performances, exhibitions, conferences
and symposiums where the student represents the school or other organisations
endorsed by the school.</p>
