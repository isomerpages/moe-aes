<p><strong><u>Tier 1: Self Leadership: Learn to Serve</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students begin by engaging in Values-in-Action (VIA) activities, developing
a sense of responsibility and community service. VIA activiies are learning
experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible
citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning
and application of values, knowledge and skills.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 2: Peer Leadership: Serve to Lead</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As students mature, they take on leadership roles as Class Committee members,
Co - Curricular Activities (CCA) leaders, Peer Support Leaders and Student
Councillors. They lead initiatives, support their peers and gain experience
in organising school events while building their leadership and interpersonal
skills.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 3: School and Community Leadership: Lead to Inspire</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Upper Secondary, students assume greater leadership responsibilities
as CCA Leaders, Senior Councillors and Senior Peer Support Leaders. They
lead school-wide initiatives, plan community service projects and collaborate
with others to inspire positive change in school and beyond.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive leadership development, the DINAN Leadership
Programme at AES develops well-rounded individuals who positively impact
both their school and the broader community.
