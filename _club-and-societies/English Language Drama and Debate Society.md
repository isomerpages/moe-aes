### About Us

_**“If you can speak, you can influence; if you can influence, you can change lives."**_

Driven by this quote, the English Language Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS), a vibrant and vocal group of students, aims to share their passion for youth, life, and the arts. Established in 2015, the ELDDS complements our school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme, SPEAK, by providing platforms for students to further hone their speaking and presentation skills.

The ELDDS Drama members believe in bringing out the themes of life through dramatic expression. Every year, the group participates actively for various school events to convey various messages that are close to the heart of today’s youths. Beyond the memorisation of lines and learning various dramatic techniques, Drama members strive to discover and use their voice and personality in bringing to life their characters on stage to reach out and touch lives.

Through debate training sessions, ELDDS Debaters develop valuable critical thinking skills and grow to be more widely read and analytical about many issues the world faces today. These skills are put to the test at national debating platforms such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships (SSSDC). In addition to these platforms, our debaters further hone their mettle and skills in inter-school debating competitions.

The ELDDS puts a lot of heart and soul into their work. It is through the performance of words (litera) that the ELDDS hopes to develop students who are steeped in character, culture (cultura) and conduct (mores).
