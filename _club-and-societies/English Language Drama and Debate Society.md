<p><strong><em>“Speak with poise. Think with purpose. Grow with heart"</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At ELDDS, every voice matters. Whether you’re performing on stage or speaking
from the floor, we believe that confidence, clarity, and conviction can
be nurtured in each of our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA brings together two vibrant strands – <em>Drama</em> and <em>Debate</em> – each offering distinct training and opportunities.</strong> From
persuasive speeches to powerful performances, our members develop the skills
to express themselves across different modes, styles, and settings.</p>

<p>ELDDS meets every Tuesday, and occasionally on Thursdays, for focused,
energising sessions in Drama or Debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step into an ELDDS session and you’ll experience the energy of students
leading with purpose, growing in confidence, and working closely as a team.
From spirited debates to creative drama rehearsals, our sessions are filled
with focus, laughter, and learning.</p>
<p>With dedicated teachers offering guidance and seniors mentoring juniors,
we cultivate not just performance and speaking skills – but resilience,
camaraderie, and character.</p>
<p>In all we do, we live out our school motto <em>Labor Omnia Vincit</em> –
through hard work, we conquer all.</p>

<p><strong>Rooted in the Assumption values of <em>Compassion</em>, <em>Integrity</em>, and <em>Excellence</em>, we believe in lifting one another up. </strong>Regardless
of background, personality, or starting point, no one gets left behind.
We take pride not only in our consistent record of excellence in competitions,
but also in our commitment to outdoing ourselves – together – each time
we step into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Driven by teamwork and a passion for growth, our students have shone in
national arenas – clinching accolades at the Singapore Secondary Schools
Debating Championship (SSSDC), Mid-Year Invitational Debating Championship
(MIDs), and Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). We are also proud that many
of our students have gone on to receive personalised DSA invitations from
Junior Colleges, a quiet testament to their growth, grit, and standout
performances.</p>
