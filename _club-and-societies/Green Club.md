### About Us:

AES Green Club aims to:
Provide members with opportunities to be involved in community and environmental conservation programmes;
Educate members about the importance of biodiversity and our role and responsibilities in environmental conservation through Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (4Rs) initiatives;
Energise members to take care of our environment and green spaces, becoming the school ambassadors of environmental causes and championing the sustainability effort.

Our members are actively involved in taking care and improving green spaces in the school. Our main focus areas are the Butterfly Biodiversity Garden and the Edible Garden. We take pride in ensuring the two spaces are well taken care of. Members are given opportunities to be in touch with the latest green initiatives and we have embarked upon doing in-house composting from all the garden trimmings. The compost created are used to nourish our plots of land.

We hope to continue championing recycled arts in the school by setting up art and craft booths to allow other students opportunities to experience the joy of upcycling. The members learn to be confident to teach our fellow schoolmates how to make keychains and marbled paper etc. The message is to encourage students to think about our shared responsibility in saving the earth while enjoying the creative process.
