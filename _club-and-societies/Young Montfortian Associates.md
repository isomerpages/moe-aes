### About Us

Young Montfortian Associates (YMA) was set up with the aim of forming our young Catholic students in the Spirituality of our Founder Saint, Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort.  

YMA is a second CCA for new Secondary 1 Catholic students. During their first year in school, they will learn about the life and contributions made by Saint Montfort. Towards the end of the year, they can choose to continue their journey and become a member of any of the 5 Ministries: Media, Art & Drama, Music, Prayer Leaders and Lectors, Altar Servers & Community Building.

Through this CCA, we pray that these Catholic students will all grow to become living witnesses of Christ, who live out their baptismal promises and share the spirituality of a total commitment to Jesus through Mary as proposed by Montfort.
