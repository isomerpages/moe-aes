<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Young Montfortian Associates (YMA) was set up with the aim of forming
our young Catholic students in the Spirituality of our Founder Saint, Louis
Marie Grignion de Montfort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now into the sixth year, YMA boasts a membership of close to fifty students,
from Secondary One to Five. The Secondary Two and Four Catholic student
leaders plan and execute the YMA sessions with the guidance of their teachers-in-charge,
supported by a Canossian Sister and a Montfortian Education Officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YMA members help to organise activities, such as the Secondary 1 Recruitment
Drive, Ash Wednesday Para-Liturgy, the bi-weekly Masses held in school,
as well as Founder’s Day Mass, Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Mass
and Thanksgiving Mass. They also participate in the fundraising activities
in the nearby churches and the annual camp retreat organised by the Saint
Gabriel’s Foundation. In addition, they also work closely with nearby primary
schools, such as De La Salle Primary and St Anthony’s Canossian Primary
School, to take part in community-building activities.</p>
<p>YMA is a second CCA for all Secondary 1 Catholic students. During their
first year in school, they will learn about the life and contributions
of Saint Montfort. Towards the end of the year, they can choose to continue
their journey and become a member of any of the following Ministries: Media,
Art &amp; Drama, Music, Prayer Leaders and Lectors, Altar Servers &amp;
Community Building.</p>
<p>The CCA provides a platform for the Catholic students to grow to become
living witnesses of Christ, who live out their baptismal promises and share
the spirituality of a total commitment to Jesus through Mary as proposed
by Saint Louis de Montfort.</p>
