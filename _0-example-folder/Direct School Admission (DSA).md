<h4><strong><u>About DSA</u></strong></h4>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system,
via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic
and non-academic achievements and talents.&nbsp;</p>
