<p>The Young Scientists Programme (YSP) is a stretch programme for students
interested in Science to <strong>deepen their scientific knowledge </strong>and <strong>develop their critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills</strong>.
Through learning journeys, competitions, workshops and collaborations with
various educational institutions, the YSP seeks to provide exposure and
substantial learning opportunities for our students in the area of Science.These
are some of the external competitions and programmes that a YSP student
may take part in to provide opportunities for <u>experiential learning</u> beyond

<blockquote>
<p>Leadership Framework of YSP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this 3-year journey, we provide different platforms for them to
serve and lead the school and community in the areas of science and technology.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 2</u></strong>
<br><strong>Focus: Peer Leadership</strong>
<br>Our Secondary 2 YSP students will participate in two signature programmes
to develop their leadership and communication among their peers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>“Every Singaporean a Naturalist (ESN)” programme</strong> in partnership
with Nature Society Singapore (NSS). Through this programme, YSP students
will monitor and share about the biodiversity within school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AES Science Bites! Programe</strong>. Through this programme,
YSP students will be guided through science content creation that will
be featured on @aes_ysp on Instagram.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><u>Secondary 3</u></strong>
<br><strong>Focus: Community Leadership</strong>
<br>Secondary 3 YSP students will take the lead in crafting suitable enrichment
programmes to engage the school community and beyond.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Soap-making Workshop</strong>. In this workshop, our YSP students
will guide their peers and teachers to create handmade soaps as well as
educate them on the science behind soap-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urban Farming workshop</strong>. In this workshop, students teach
their peers and teachers about sustainable methods of farming that can
be used to grow their very own plants at home.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Mass-Escape Game</strong>. This science-based escape game
is carefully developed and curated by our YSP students. With the use of
interesting and challenging riddles and scenarios, it aims to spark an
interest in science in the participants.</p>
</li>

<p><strong><u>Secondary 4</u></strong>
<br><strong>Focus: Thought Leadership</strong>
<br>As the seniors of the school, Secondary 4 YSP students are given the opportunity
to be <strong>mentors </strong>for their juniors. We hope that they will

peers towards positive action through effective communication in order
to become active contributors in the community.</p>
