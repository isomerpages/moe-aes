<br>Students will embark on Students Initiated Learning (SIL) on Blended Learning
days. Students have a choice in what they would like to learn within the
curated semestral themes. Students will document and share their learning
on their students’ e-portfolio Google site, which will be useful to showcase
their learning and achievement to potential employers or interviewers when
applying for higher education institutions.</p>
