<p>Blended Learning offers students a cohesive and flexible learning experience
either online or offline, by combining different modes of instruction.
In Assumption English School, the traditional Home-Based Learning is known
as Blended Learning Day. It is a regular part of the school programme,
every fortnightly and allows students to learn independently from home
while remaining connected to their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of Blended Learning:</strong>
<br>- To nurture self-directed and independent learners as they explore concepts
and conduct research.
<br>- To equip our students with stronger abilities, dispositions and habits
for independent and lifelong learning.
<br>- To develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.
<br>- To deepen digital literacies in learners.
<br>- To develop learners who can apply knowledge of cyber wellness and cyber
security to safeguard their online learning.</p>

<br>Students will embark on Students Initiated Learning (SIL) on Blended Learning
days. Students have a choice in what they would like to learn within the
curated semestral themes. Students will document and share their learning
on their students’ e-portfolio Google site, which will be useful to showcase
their learning and achievement to potential employers or interviewers when
applying for higher education institutions.</p>
