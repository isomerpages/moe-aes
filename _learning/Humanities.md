<p><strong>Humanities@AES aims to be REAL and RELEVANT for all AssumptionKnights.</strong> 
<br>In the constantly evolving world, we continue to help our learners stay
abreast with current affairs in our classrooms, leveraging on the use of
technology to bring the world closer to our learners, encouraging them
to take on the hats of thoughtful Geographers, empathetic Historians and
keen learners of Social Studies, so that they may become Men and Women
who possess a heart for service and a mind that is ready to advocate for
positive change.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Key programmes</u></strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Lower Secondary Geographical Investigation</strong></h5>
<p>In Geography, the Lower Secondary students were able to meaningfully examine
the rainforest environment in Dairy Farm Nature Park and conduct site observation
surveys at Bangkit Housing Estate for their investigations. The Secondary
Two fieldwork process culminated with the design of their ‘Dream Neighbourhood’,
enabling them to use their creativity and imagination to work towards better
quality of life and town sustainability in their proposed neighbourhoods.</p>

<h5><strong>Lower Secondary Historical Investigation</strong></h5>
<p>History came alive for the Lower Secondary students when they visited
museums. The Secondary One students examined the lives of the immigrants
from the early 1900s through their visit to the National Museum of Singapore,
discovering the contributions and challenges of the early immigrants in
Singapore. The immersive first-person views of the artefacts and exhibits
also enabled the Secondary Two students to better understand the Japanese
Occupation, and to empathise with the suffering that ensued during the
visit to the Ford Factory of Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Upper Secondary Humanities</u></strong></h4>
<p>AssumptionKnights continue to use the Inquiry Model to guide their thought
processes to articulate their opinions, whilst exercising empathy through
active listening for other ideas shared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, in History classrooms, AssumptionKnights develop empathy
towards the different groups of people who lived during Hitler’s rule.
For Social Studies, learners apply their learnt knowledge into the level
Values-in-Action projects in conjunction with the school’s Empathy Week,
evaluating if people with disabilities have sufficient support. Geography
students also deepen their knowledge on physical-human interactions through
topics in Geography in Everyday Life, Climate and Tourism. Opportunities
to exercise their analytical minds are created through more open Geographical
Investigations at the upper secondary levels.</p>

<h4><strong>G1 Humanities (including Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs))</strong></h4>
<p>The G1 Social Studies syllabuses are organised around broad issues which
will anchor class discussions. In exploring the real-world societal issues
in the syllabuses using the inquiry-based learning model, our learners
learn to extract, analyse and evaluate information whilst working with
one another towards common Performance Tasks and HEMs (Geography, History
and Literature). Through application, they develop collaborative skills,
as well as deepen their understanding of society and the world they live
in.</p>
