<p>Our Craft &amp; Technology (C&amp;T) Department brings together three
exciting subjects – <strong>Art</strong>, <strong>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>,
and <strong>Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS)</strong>.</p>
<p>At Assumption English School, all Lower Secondary students take Art, D&amp;T,
and Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) as part of their core curriculum.
These hands-on subjects help students develop creativity, problem-solving,
and practical life skills – all essential for 21st-century learning.</p>
<p>Whether it’s designing a product, preparing a nutritious meal, or creating
a work of art, students learn by doing – and grow in confidence, creativity,
and innovation.</p>
<h4><strong>Art</strong></h4>
<p>The Art unit infuses Art Inquiry Based Model to ensure students can experience
authentic and creative learning opportunities. For the lower secondary
level students, art is all about discovery and exploring the world around
them. Students are encouraged to participate in various art activities
and competitions, and many can also showcase their talents in a range of
school-based exhibitions and projects.</p>

<h4><strong>Design &amp; Technology</strong></h4>
<p>The focus is on areas of design communication, research, ideation and
development, and decision-making. They are trained to continuously be critical
of their work and seek better alternatives where possible, frequently reviewing
and evaluating their decisions throughout the design process.</p>
<p>The D&amp;T unit initiated the integrated C&amp;T program where the prototypes
developed in D&amp;T are used&nbsp; in Art and FCE programmes.</p>

<h4><strong>Nutrition and Food Science</strong></h4>
<p>The NFS unit aims to enhance the learning of nutrition and food science
through meaningful activities that connect to real-life issues. Students
participate in cooking competitions and attend food innovation workshops.
The focus for the lower secondary students is for students to discover
the importance of good nutrition through practical activities. While, the
focus for upper secondary students is to deepen students’ application of
food science and nutrition concepts through exploration, investigation
and evaluation skills with real-world examples. Understanding the importance
of post-secondary options for our students, the unit organises learning
journeys to relevant post-secondary institution and enrichment programmes.
Through this, students are exposed to the area of food science and technology,
as well as in the field of culinary science.</p>
