<p>Chinese Author-in-Residence Programme</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year, we were honoured to welcome acclaimed local writer as part
of our Author-in-Residence Programme. Through mentorship sessions, the
author guided our students in developing their creative writing skills
while fostering a deeper appreciation for Chinese literature. These engaging
sessions provided students with invaluable opportunities to learn from
an accomplished writer's experience and insights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Malay Literature Appreciation Programme</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AES Malay Language Literature Appreciation Programme utilises short
stories from the components in the Malay Language Syllabus to teach Secondary
1, 2 and 3 students reading and critical thinking skills. Students read,
process and construct meaning from literary texts&nbsp; and other relevant
reading materials before analysing themes and issues from multiple perspectives.
This increases studentsâ€™ involvement and motivation in learning Malay.</p>
