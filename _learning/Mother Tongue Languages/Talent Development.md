</blockquote>
<p>In an outstanding performance, five of our Assumptionknights secured their
places in the finals of this competition, emerging from an impressive field
of over 11,000 participants representing 94 schools across Singapore. During
the live on-site finals, our students demonstrated exceptional calligraphy
skills and artistic composure under time pressure.</p>
<p>We are especially proud to announce that two of our finalists achieved
even greater heights, clinching the Merit Award at the Secondary School
level! This remarkable accomplishment reflects not only their artistic
talent and technical mastery. Their achievement stands as an inspiration
to their peers and a testament to their dedication in preserving the fine
art of Chinese calligraphy.</p>
