**Chinese Cultural Performance Exposure Programme (CPES)** <br>
This year, secondary one students were fortunate to participate in the Chinese Cultural Performance Exposure Programme, which featured the renowned theatrical production "The Monkey King Borrow Treasure From Dragon Palace." on 11 May. The programme aimed to offer students an immersive experience of Chinese language-related cultural performances, thereby highlighting the practical relevance of the language and providing them with an opportunity to apply their Chinese language knowledge in a real-world context.

**Author-in-Residence Programme**<br>
In Term 4, our students also had the opportunity to meet and learn personally from renowned local writer 蔡志礼博士 Dr Chua Chee Lay for the Author-in-Residence Programme. The programme focusses particularly on the development of creative writing skills and promoting a love and appreciation of Chinese literature among students.
