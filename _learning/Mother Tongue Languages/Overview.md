<p>The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department strives to nurture passion
and appreciation for MTL in every Assumptionknight. Through an immersive
and engaging learning environment, we make language learning meaningful,
relevant and connected to the real world, ensuring our students see the
value of their Mother Tongue beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Our programmes are designed around authentic learning experiences that
develop critical thinkers and confident communicators. By integrating real-life
contexts and cultural appreciation in our teaching, we empower our Assumptionknights
to embrace their cultural heritage and use their Mother Tongue effectively
in everyday life, helping them grow into individuals who proudly exemplify
their cultural values.</p>
