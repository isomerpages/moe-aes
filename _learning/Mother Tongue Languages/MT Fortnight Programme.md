<p>Festitive Celebrations</p>

<p>The MTL department embraces the rich cultural tapestry of Singapore through
our vibrant festive celebrations. Throughout the year, our Assumptionknights
participate in meaningful celebrations of Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and
Deepavali. These cultural events feature engaging performances including
traditional songs and dances as well as drama skits that bring cultural
stories to life.</p>

<p><strong>‘Packing Love, Sharing Abundance’ Chinese New Year Food Donation Drive</strong>
</p>
<p>In the spirit of Chinese New Year, our students participate in this meaningful
initiative to share blessings with the less fortunate in our community.
Through collecting and packing essential food items, Assumptionknights
learn valuable lessons about compassion, generosity, and social responsibility,
while making a positive impact on those in need during the festive season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extensive Reading Programme</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our reading programme provides Assumptionknights with access to curated
online reading materials, including e-books in their MTL. Through this
programme, we aim to nurture a lifelong love for reading whilst strengthening
our students' proficiency in their respective MTL. The programme extends
beyond term time, enabling our students to engage in enriching reading
activities during their school holidays, thereby fostering continuous learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme (CCM)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our CCM Programme opens doors to cross-cultural communication by introducing
Secondary 1 students to basic conversational skills in another Mother Tongue
language. Students learn essential everyday phrases and expressions in
either Chinese or Malay, enabling them to engage in simple conversations
with their peers from different cultural backgrounds. Through this programme,
we aim to foster cultural understanding and strengthen bonds within our
diverse school community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultural Theatre Exposure Programme</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Cultural Theatre Exposure Programme brings MTL to life through immersive
theatrical experiences. By attending professional cultural performances,
students experience the vibrancy of their MTL beyond textbooks and classrooms.
These enriching experiences help our students develop a deeper appreciation
for both language and cultural arts.</p>
