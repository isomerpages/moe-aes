<blockquote>
<p>Our Vision</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Assumption English School, the English &amp; Literature Department
is committed to nurturing students who are confident, articulate, and <strong>future-ready</strong>.
<br>Our vision is to <strong>develop students’ competency in the English Language, cultivate a lifelong love of reading, and empower them to communicate proficiently and meaningfully</strong>.
We aim to shape not only skilled language users but also thoughtful, empathetic
individuals who can use language to connect, lead, and inspire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Approach</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our programmes are guided by the <strong>MOE English Language Syllabus 2020</strong>,
which emphasises five key areas: <strong>Listening, Reading, Viewing, Speaking, and Writing</strong>.</p>
<p>We design our lessons around <strong>real-world tasks</strong> that help
students become active thinkers and confident communicators. They analyse
media, construct arguments, present ideas, and engage with diverse audiences
– all while building core language competencies. Our goal is to equip students
with the skills to express themselves effectively and responsibly in a
digital and global world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signature Programme – SPEAK</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The department leads the school’s <strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong>: <strong>SPEAK – SPeak English with grAce and Knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>Established in 2015, SPEAK provides students with authentic platforms
to hone their public speaking, media literacy, and presentation skills.
Through performances, advocacy projects, and student-led showcases, SPEAK
empowers students to speak with purpose, grace, and clarity – skills essential
for personal growth and societal engagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Literature - Exploring Humanity Through Words</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Literature programme, aligned with the <strong>Literature in English Syllabus</strong>,
develops students who:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy reading and engaging with literary texts</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand and appreciate diverse cultures and perspectives</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respond personally and critically to texts</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyse literary features and authorial intent</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicate informed interpretations in spoken and written form</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our classrooms, Literature is more than a subject – it’s a window into
the human condition. Students explore a rich variety of texts and voices
that spark empathy, reflection, and inquiry.</p>
<p>We connect literature to <strong>authentic, real-life applications</strong> through
drama activities, performance-based assessments, multimedia responses,
and discussions on contemporary issues reflected in the texts. These experiences
help students see how literature shapes understanding – and action – in
the real world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guided by Our Values</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rooted in our school motto, <strong>Labor Omnia Vincit</strong> (<em>Through hard work, we conquer all</em>),
the English &amp; Literature Department is committed to helping every student
grow – regardless of background or starting point.</p>
<p>We believe that language and literature have the power to transform. Our
mission is to ensure that every student finds their voice, expresses it
with purpose, and steps into the future ready to lead with heart, skill,
and conviction.</p>
