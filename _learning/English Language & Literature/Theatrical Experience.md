Our students have had the opportunity to attend plays such as “Perfecting Pratas”, “The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas” and the upcoming “Juliet”. These experiences will definitely be memorable as part of our students’ secondary school journey; allowing them to develop a love and appreciation for the language through such artistic forms.
