<p>At Assumption English School, we believe that literature should not only
be studied—it should be <strong>felt, seen, and experienced</strong>. That’s
why our English &amp; Literature Department actively seeks opportunities
to bring texts to life through thoughtfully curated theatre experiences.</p>
<p>Each year, the department is committed to create such experiences, reflecting
our <strong>ongoing commitment to providing authentic, real-world learning</strong> that
deepens students’ engagement with literature and the arts.</p>
<p>Most recently, students across various levels attended live performances
of their set texts, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em> – a moving portrayal that helped
students understand the emotional and historical weight of the novel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Don’t Know Don’t Care</em> – a locally resonant production that sparked
important conversations on empathy and social awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> – offered them a chance to see Shakespeare’s
language and themes brought to life through a performance under the stars.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One standout experience was our <strong>Shakespeare in the Park</strong> learning
journey, made possible through a special partnership with the <strong>Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT)</strong>.
Our Secondary 3 Literature students not only enjoyed a powerful outdoor
performance of <em>Macbeth</em>, but also received <strong>exclusive backstage access</strong>.
This gave them rare insight into the behind-the-scenes workings of a professional
theatre production—from set and costume design to stage direction and technical
effects. It was a rich, <strong>authentic learning experience</strong> that
expanded their appreciation of the Arts and deepened their understanding
of theatre as a form of storytelling.</p>

<p>These experiences exemplify our belief in <strong>learning beyond the textbook</strong>—where
literature becomes a lived experience, and students grow not only in skills,
but also in empathy, imagination, and insight.</p>
