<h4><strong>National Schools Literature Festival 2025</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) is Singapore’s biggest
celebration of Literature for schools, and AES students have shone on this
stage. NSLF is one of the many platforms AES offers to stretch talent and
nurture passionate, articulate communicators.</p>
<p>This year, our teams impressed in Debates, Book Trailers, and Poetry Slam,
showcasing sharp thinking, creativity, and expressive performance. Competing
at the national level gave our students the confidence to speak up, collaborate,
and celebrate their love of Literature alongside peers from schools across
Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>AES Poetry Showdown 2025</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The AES Poetry Showdown is our annual signature event where students and
teachers take the stage to perform their original poems. In 2025, the theme <em>“Feasting”</em> inspired
a rich variety of voices — from witty verses to moving reflections.</p>
<p>Students showed courage in presenting their work to a live audience, while
teachers joined in to model a love for Literature and creativity. The event
not only celebrated writing and performance but also strengthened our school’s
culture of expression and community.</p>

<p>The Poetry Showdown gives every AssumptionKnight a platform to be heard,
proving that poetry is alive, powerful, and fun at AES. It is also a culmination
of the creative writing experiences provided to students as part of their
Literature curriculum in the school.
