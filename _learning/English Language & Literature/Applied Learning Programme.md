<p>The SPEAK Programme provides ample opportunities for all students to develop
their speaking skills in an interactive and safe learning environment.
These include projects at each level to showcase their speaking skills.
For example, our Secondary 2 students take on the role of reporters to
shed light on occupations that interest them.</p>

<p>Our Secondary 3 students put up campaigns on a topic they would like to
be advocates for and present it during assembly or their lunch breaks.
It is a daunting experience speaking to a live audience but our students
have shown much courage and resilience in taking up the challenge and carrying
themselves very well during the live presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, all our Secondary 4 &amp; 5 students embarked on a project
to create a one-minute introductory clip of themselves to be included in
their portfolios for tertiary education and beyond. They applied the skills
learnt over the 4 – 5 years at AES and the introductory video clips were
not only creative but also invigorating.</p>

<p>Students who show a flair for speaking can showcase their talents in oratorical
contests and given student emcee roles at school events and programmes.
We hope to continue building and enhancing students’ love for the language
through the wide array of programmes we have.
