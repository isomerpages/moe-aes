English Language and Literature Programme
-----------------------------------------

**Vision** <br>
_To develop students’ competency in the English Language, cultivating a life-long habit of reading and the ability to communicate proficiency and confidently such that they not only become confident users of the language but also show appreciation and love for it._

  

The department runs the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) titled&nbsp;**SP**eak&nbsp;**E**nglish with&nbsp;gr**A**ce and&nbsp;**K**nowledge (**SPEAK**). Established in 2015, the SPEAK programme aims to develop confident and eloquent communicators who can articulate their thoughts and opinions well.
