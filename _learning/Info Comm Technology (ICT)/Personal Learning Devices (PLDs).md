<p>In AES, every student owns a <strong>Personal Learning Device (PLD).</strong> This
allows each student to participate seamlessly in technology-mediated lessons
carefully planned by AES teachers.
<br>The PLD initiative is part of MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme
(NDLP) and it aims to:</p>

<p>From 2025, the PLD bundle used by AES students is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apple iPad 10.9” 10th Gen (64GB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessories: Apple Pencil USB-C + Logitech Ruggedized Combo Keyboard</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iPads </strong>are chosen for their variety of affordances, including
seamless learning experiences alongside existing teaching and learning
technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS), Google Suite for
Education and Microsoft 365 applications. It is also a relatively lightweight
and portable device that offers students convenient learning on-the-move.
A full charge of the battery typically allows students to work on their
PLDs for the entire curriculum hours. Moreover, the Apple Pencil offers
excellent affordances for inking, note-taking and drawing.</p>
<p>Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.
