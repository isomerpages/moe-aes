<p>At Assumption English School, our Physical Education (PE) programme is
all about <em>student-centered learning</em> – where every student’s growth,
interests, and experiences shape the way we teach.</p>
<p>Our lessons are active, engaging, and meaningful. Instead of just running
drills, we use fun, game-based approaches like <strong>Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU)</strong> and <strong>Non-Linear Pedagogy</strong>.
These help students become better thinkers, team players, and confident
decision-makers during real game situations.</p>
<p>We believe in <em>learning through play</em> – using modified games to teach
strategy, movement, and communication. Students explore, adapt, and reflect,
building both skill and a love for physical activity.</p>
<p>Beyond the court, our <strong>Outdoor Education</strong> programme connects
students with nature through activities like the Sec 1 Camp, Sec 3 Outward
Bound Singapore (OBS), hiking, and team challenges. These experiences build
resilience, self-awareness, and responsibility.</p>
<p>We also celebrate learning through exciting events like the <strong>Inter-class Games</strong> and
the <strong>AssumptionKnight Challenge</strong> – giving students the chance
to compete, collaborate, and shine in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>More than just sports, our PE programme inspires <em>lifelong well-being</em>,
teamwork, and personal excellence – preparing students to move, think,
and grow in all aspects of life.</p>
