<p>Assumption English School Mathematics teachers believe in imbuing AssumptionKnights
with an appreciation of Mathematics and help them see the relevance of
Mathematics in their daily lives. AssumptionKnights will be nurtured to
be confident and resilient problem-solvers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key programmes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Kite Design and Flying Task</u></strong>
<br>Secondary One AssumptionKnights learn to incorporate Mathematical concepts
such as angles, arithmetic, shapes, and area, as well as Physics concepts
like drag and thrust. AssumptionKnights design and test their kites to
determine which one stays up in the air for the longest duration.</p>

<p><strong><u>Learning Experiences in Classrooms</u></strong>
<br>These experiences create opportunities for AssumptionKnights to think
critically, reason logically and communicate effectively, working individually
as well as in groups.</p>

<p><strong><u>Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC)</u></strong>
<br>The objective of SMKC is to popularize mathematical enrichment activities
among students in Singapore. Students will achieve certification and recognition
from an internationally prominent educational body. Students are then able
to include the SMKC certificate in their portfolio to strengthen their
application for top schools, universities and scholarships. It also exposes
students to interesting math problems which are designed by internationally
renowned math educators. Students can apply their knowledge in Mathematics
that they learned in school in this competition.</p>
