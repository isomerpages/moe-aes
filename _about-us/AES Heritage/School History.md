In 1973, the Secondary section of CHIJ Bukit Timah merged with Boys’ Town English School and the school became a Co-educational Catholic mission School.

  

The School took on the name of Assumption English School in honour of our Lady, Mother Mary, the Patroness of the Brothers of St Gabriel.

The school progressed rapidly and in 1989, the school authorities decided to upgrade the facilities to better meet the demands of education for the new millennium.

  

In December 1992, the Primary Section of the school closed and the students were absorbed by St. Anthony's Primary School.
