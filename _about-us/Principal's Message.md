**Growing Together – Learn with Joy, Lead with Purpose**

Our theme, "Growing Together – Learn with Joy, Lead with Purpose," signals our continual desire to foster a supportive and inclusive environment where both students and staff can flourish and learn.
<br>
As a Catholic mission school, we uphold the belief that character development is integral to the educational journey. Inspired by the founding figure of our mission, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, we are committed to serve others. Our CHRIST values - Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Sense of Responsibility, and Trust - guide our students to grow stronger and encouraging them to lead lives that prioritize others' well-being alongside their own achievements. &nbsp;We strive to help our students discover their unique strengths and work with one another to achieve greater good.

**Learn with Joy**
<br>
This academic year, we emphasise fostering a love for learning with curiosity and creativity. While the journey of learning requires effort, it can be a fulfilling endeavor. Teachers will guide their students to actively nurture a curious mindset and a zest for life. &nbsp;

We are committed to equipping every student for the future through our forward-looking curriculum in a technology-enabled environment. &nbsp;Students gain confidence through our SPEAK Applied Learning Programme, as they are given opportunities to speak on various platforms.&nbsp; The overall curriculum is also designed to enable them to attain 21st Century Skills and Competencies.

**Lead with Purpose**
<br>
Embracing Montfort's spirit, we nurture purpose-driven leaders with a genuine desire to serve and make a meaningful impact. The AES Dinan Leadership Programme offers students the chance to develop their leadership skills and competencies through service learning.&nbsp;

They will foster friendship ties with international visitors through the annual Asian Youth Leaders for Human Fraternity (AYLHF) programme where visitors from Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia come together to appreciate one another’s culture and discuss how we work towards a better world everyone.

**Growing Together**
<br>
As we embark on this new year, we place our trust in God for His guidance and blessings, firmly believing that "in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." (Romans 8:28)
