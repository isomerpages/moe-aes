**Together, from Strength to Strength - Labor Omnia Vincit**

I would like to express our gratitude to Mr Benjamin Kwok for his exceptional leadership of the school from 2018 to 2023. We wish him all the best as he embarks on his next leadership journey as principal of Crest Secondary School.

As we begin a new academic year, I am reminded of the sense of togetherness that has brought our school to where it is today. Last year, we celebrated our 70th anniversary, and I am grateful to the many stakeholders who have contributed to our success over the years. With the continued support and love of everyone, I am confident that our school will continue to grow from strength to strength.

**Character Strength**

As a Catholic mission school, we believe that character strength is an important part of the educational experience. Drawing inspiration from the founding Father of our mission, St Louis Marie de Monfort, our staff and students care deeply about the last, the least, and the lost. &nbsp;Embedded in our CHRIST values of Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Sense of Responsibility, and Trust is our desire to see our students grow from strength to strength and become men and women who believe not just in doing well in life but in living for others. This is an ongoing work and will remain a main focus of our school.

**Strength in preparing every student for the future**

We are committed to preparing every student for the future with our forward-looking curriculum. Our students find the motivation to do well in life as they go through the well-designed educational experiences at AES. Notably, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), the Dinan Leadership Programme provides opportunities for students to develop leadership and 21st Century Skills through service learning. We also harness technology to enhance classroom experiences and 21st Century Competencies of our students. We will continue to invest time and resources to equip our teachers and empower our students.

**Labor Omnia Vincit – Through work achieve success.**

At Assumption English School, we believe every student has unique strengths which can be used for common good. They will have opportunities to ask of themselves “Can I really offer something?” and “Can I contribute?” in every aspect of their school and life.

As we embark on the new year, we want to place our trust in God and His provision and believe that we can do all things through Him who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13).
