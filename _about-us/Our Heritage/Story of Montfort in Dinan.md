One night while returning from a mission in Dinan, Louis Marie found a poor and sick man all covered with sores on the street.

  

He carried him on his back and brought him to the mission house. The door keeper of the house where he stayed was very much astonished to hear him knock at the door one night and cry aloud several times: “Open to Jesus Christ!”

  

He took the sick man to his own room, laid him on his bed and spent the night either praying or warming and nursing the sick man. Louis Marie saw in the poor the person of God Himself.

  

This story reminds AssumptionKnights to serve the lost, the last and the least, by lending a helping hand to those in need whenever they can.
