<p>Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’
development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge
and skills.</p>
<p>VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community.
As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have
put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>In alignment to Assumption English School’s values to develop our Assumptionknights
to be compassionate and empathetic contributors to the society, the VIA
programme is a multi-prong approach which builds on progressive and engaging
experiences of our students as they move on from year to year.</p>
<p>Assumption English School uses a multi-prong approach in VIA based on:</p>
