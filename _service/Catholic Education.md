<p>Catholicity in our school seeks to nurture the spiritual growth of our
students and staff by providing opportunities to live out our faith in
prayer, service, and community. Rooted in the Montfortian tradition, it
strengthens our Catholic identity, fosters a spirit of compassion and fellowship,
and guides us to grow as men and women for God and for others.</p>
<p>Every Friday, our Catholic students and teachers gather to keep our Faith
Alive! These sessions are moments to pray together, deepen our understanding
of the Faith, and build stronger connections as a community. In journeying
with our fellow brothers and sisters, we are reminded that we are never
alone, and this shared fellowship helps us face the challenges of school
with strength and hope.</p>
