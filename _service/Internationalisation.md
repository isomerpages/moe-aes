<h4><strong><u>Developing Assumptionknights Through Holistic and Global Learning Experiences</u></strong></h4>
<p>At Assumption English School, we are committed to providing every Assumptionknight
with a holistic education—one that nurtures not just academic growth, but
also character, life skills, and values essential for thriving in a complex
world. We believe that meaningful, authentic experiences are key to developing
future-ready individuals.</p>
<p>As part of our holistic development framework, our <strong>Internationalisation Programme</strong> plays
a vital role in equipping students with 21st Century competencies, such
as global awareness and cross-cultural understanding. Through overseas
learning journeys, students gain first-hand experience interacting with
diverse cultures and communities, broadening their perspectives and deepening
their empathy.</p>
<p>We are proud to offer every Assumptionknight the opportunity to participate
in <strong>at least one overseas learning programme</strong> during their
secondary school journey. These experiences serve as powerful platforms
for self-discovery, teamwork, and values-in-action.</p>
<p>Our outbound <strong>Cultural Exchange Programmes</strong> for <strong>Secondary 3 students</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange Programme at<strong> Shanghai – Hangzhou, China</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange Programme with <strong>Assumption College, Bangkok</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange Programme with <strong>Assumption College, Lampang</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange Programme with <strong>Montfort College, Chiangmai</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange and Service Learning Programme in <strong>Vietnam</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Exchange and Service Learning Programme in <strong>Cambodia</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These programmes not only strengthen ties with our Assumption network
and regional partners, but also deepen our students’ appreciation for different
cultures and the importance of service to others. We are confident that
such experiences will empower Assumptionknights to grow as compassionate
leaders and responsible global citizens.</p>
<h4><u>Reflections from 2025's Overseas Trips</u></h4>
<p>This year, our Secondary 3 students, joined by 16 teachers, embarked on
two overseas Cultural and Immersion Programmes—one in Bangkok, Thailand
and another in Shanghai and Hangzhou, China—expanding their global perspectives
through unique learning experiences.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, students immersed themselves in the Thai culture, participating
in activities such as learning Muay Thai, crafting traditional handicrafts.
They also engaged in cultural arts like Thai cooking, classical dance and
playing musical instruments like the Ranad and Khim. Students also visited
the Ancient City in Samut Prakan, an outdoor museum, and participated in
a Thai dessert-making class where they learned to prepare two types of
Thai desserts: Papaya Salad and Thai Glutinous Rice Ball Dessert. At the
Sam Phran District, the students participated in four sustainability workshops,
which included hands-on activities like rice farming, clay figurine making,
paper flower crafting, and creating eco-friendly bags with organic flowers.</p>
<p>A visit to Kanchanaburi Elephant World gave students an eye-opening experience
in elephant conservation. They learned about the natural behaviors of elephants,
the challenges they face, and the significance of sustainable tourism practices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another group of students took part in AES's first-ever Cultural
and Immersion Programme in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In Shanghai, they witnessed
the city's fusion of tradition and modernity, visiting iconic sites like
The Bund and Yu Garden, and gaining insights into China’s rapid urban growth.
In Hangzhou, the scenic West Lake provided a peaceful contrast to the vibrant
city life, deepening the students' appreciation for China’s cultural heritage.
They also explored technological advancements at innovation hubs, showcasing
China’s leadership in science and technology.</p>
<p>During their visits to schools in both Thailand and China, our students
were warmly welcomed by local students. In Thailand, their Thai buddies
went above and beyond to assist, even helping those not directly assigned
to them. Similarly, in China, local students shared their culture enthusiastically,
ensuring our AssumptionKnights felt at home. Inspired by these experiences,
our students expressed a strong desire to offer the same warmth and hospitality
to future visitors at AES.</p>
<h4><br><u>Past Trips</u></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Thailand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>32 Secondary 3 students and 5 teachers participated in a Cultural and
Immersion Programme to Thailand, Bangkok. Both teachers and students enjoyed
themselves learning local sport, Muay Thai, as well as making local handicrafts.
They also had the opportunity to join our friends from Assumption College,
Bangkok for Thai Cooking Practices, Thai Classical Dance, Thai Musical
Instruments (Ranad &amp; Khim), Thai Puppets (Hun Krabok) and Making of
Kra Thong.</p>
<p>“Our Thai buddies are so generous and helpful! They helped us a lot during
the trip when we visited their school during our second and third day.
They were also very welcoming. Even though some of the students are not
our buddies or not involved in the particular activity, they went the extra
mile to help us when we were lost and were very friendly, making us feel
comfortable. I would want our guests to feel the same way that I felt when
they visit us next time.” - Cassiel Cheong 3/4</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vietnam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who went on the Vietnam Cultural and Service Learning Trip came
back home feeling grateful and appreciative of every single grain of rice.
During their visit, the students had the opportunity to experience rice
planting on a paddy field!</p>
<p>“We realised that it was not an easy job! What we did was only a fraction
of the rice farmer’s job. This experience had taught us not to waste food
because a lot of hard work has gone into providing our one bowl of rice.”
- Adawiyah 3/1</p>
<p>For their service learning, the students visited an orphanage and interacted
with the children there. They played games, taught them simple English
as well as simple handicraft. Though the time spent together was short,
the experience there has indeed tug at their heartstrings. Our students
bade goodbye with tears swelling in their eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cambodia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I chose to go on the Cambodia Cultural Exchange Trip because I saw it
as an opportunity to gain a greater understanding of different cultures,
and actively serve those who are less fortunate. The most memorable part
of the trip was when we played volleyball together with the children in
Sambour Primary School. The experience changed my perception of happiness.
It taught me to take a step back from what we consider the ‘pressure’ of
our busy school lives, to put things into perspective and realise how lucky
we really are. My time in Cambodia inspired me to share my experiences
with other people and to continue to help those communities in any way
I can..”
<br>- Vinoth, 3/2</p>
<p>“After the Cambodia trip, I felt that it was very lucky that can go to
Cambodia because we get to experience the life there and get to play with
the kids in Sambour Primary School. I learn to appreciate what we have
and learn not to waste food though this trip. I feel ashamed that the kids
there are appreciative and happy about what they have and I am not, even
though I have many things and opportunities that they don’t have.” - Wong
Yee Xin, 3/5</p>
<p>Many of those who went on the Cambodia Cultural and Service Learning Trip
felt that the main highlight of the trip was the visit to their local school,
Sambour Primary School. Our students had the opportunity to teach the primary
school students about oral hygiene as well as sharing important information
on dengue fever and the preventive measures as well. Prior to the trip,
the students held a donation campaign, calling all Assumptionknights to
do their part and donate some items for them to bring along to the trip.
The trip ended with their visit to the beautiful Angkor Wat and discovering
the historical journey of the Khmer Empire.</p>
