<p>The Asian Young Leaders for Human Fraternity (AYLHF) is a youth impact
initiative by AES. It was inspired by the landmark “Document On Human Fraternity
For World Peace And Living Together”, jointly signed by Pope Francis and
the Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmad Al-Tayyeb in Feb 2019 to urge peace among
all people in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AYLHF provides a platform for young leaders of Asia to connect and communicate
with each other, building bonds and forging friendships, regardless of
race, language, religion or nationality. This promotes the importance of
mutual understanding and respect, and raises the awareness of building
human fraternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AYLHF cultivates essential 21st Century Competencies (21CC) by grounding
its activities in the core principles of inter-religious and inter-cultural
dialogue. Through immersive workshops and collaborative projects, the programme
challenges students to engage in respectful communication and deep listening
with peers from vastly different backgrounds. This process naturally sharpens
their critical thinking as they analyse complex social issues and navigate
diverse worldviews. By working together on initiatives that promote social
cohesion, participants develop strong collaboration skills and a profound
sense of global awareness, shaping them into empathetic and adaptable leaders
prepared to build bridges in a diverse world.</p>
<p>When launched in 2023 in conjunction with AES’ 70th anniversary and International
Friendship Day, it was the first of such youth impact initiatives in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AYLHF is now an annual event keenly looked forward to by all staff and
students from AES and our partner schools, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assumption College Samutprakarn, Samut Prakan, Thailand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crest Secondary School, Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindai University Junior High School, Osaka, Japan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Montfort College, Chiangmai, Thailand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St Joseph’s Junior High School, Jakarta, Indonesia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waringin Junior High School, Bandung, Indonesia</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One key highlight of the AYLHF includes the making of local hawker delight,
popiah, together. The coming together of various ingredients in popiah
forms a delectable dish that pleases the palette of many. In addition,
the mass assembly programme in the school hall showcases cultural performances
by each school which all students enjoy!&nbsp;</p>
