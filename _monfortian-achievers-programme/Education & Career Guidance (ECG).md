Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work.

  

At secondary schools, the focus is on exploration; to help students understand themselves better in their skills, interests and abilities and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st century.

Cesson Programme
----------------

The Cesson programme is an AES signature programme with a series of different activities specially designed to prepare our Secondary 4 and 5 students for the future. The name Cesson originated from the Cesson Bridge in France where our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, started his 300km journey to Paris for his theological studies on foot. 

The objectives of the Cesson programme are to develop AssumptionKnights to be:

*   self-awareness about personal interests, abilities and career aspirations
*   understanding in the various education pathways ahead, so as to make informed decisions
*   skills that will help students in their education and career path
