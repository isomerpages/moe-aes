Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community. 

The CW Framework guides schools in planning for a school-wide CW Education.

MOE uses the CW Framework to develop the child’s instincts to protect him / her and empower him / her to take responsibility for his / her own well-being in cyberspace. 

The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he / she will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. 

The framework also features a 3-step process to explore Cyber issues: **The Sense – Think – Act Process**

  1. **Sense**: Identify the possible risks of harmful behaviours online and learn how to protect oneself

 2. **Think**: Analyse, evaluate and reflect on the online situation based on the three CW principles

3. **Act**: Translate understanding into actions so as to be safe and have a positive presence online

The CW Curriculum is a critical part of CW Education and CCE offers an important platform for achieving CW outcomes. The CCE Guidance Module on CW provides systematic instruction to facilitate the development of life-long social-emotional competencies which are grounded on sound values, so that our students would be poised to harness the benefits of ICT and avoid its dangers. 

Formal CW lessons were rolled out in schools to emphasise the explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies and values in the context of the cyber world. It is centred on the three foundational principles of the CW Framework and the three big ideas, Identity, Relationships and Choices of MOE’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).
