#### Objectives:

1\. To explicitly teach behaviour in a concrete, step-by-step manner with specific and observable skill steps
 
2\. To anchor sound values in students

3\. To build positive classroom culture through promoting reinforcement of skills, prosocial norms and behavioural expectations

  

#### Social Skills

  

Social skills training complements school-based CCE efforts as an additional layer of support. Social skills are selected and taught based on the needs of the students, applicable at different juncture of their schooling life. For example, all Secondary One students will learn to be prepared for class, as they go through transition from Primary to Secondary school.
