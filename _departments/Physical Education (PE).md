In AES, our students&nbsp;**P.L.A.Y.**&nbsp;during PE. The department aims to cultivate Assumptionknights in “P.L.A.Y. –&nbsp;**P**urposeful&nbsp;**L**iving&nbsp;**A**ctive lifest**Y**le” so as to educate them in pursuing a purposeful and physically active lifestyle through active participation in sports and games.

  

AssumptionKnights have the opportunity to engage in a diverse range of sports and games, including Badminton, Basketball, Football, Floorball, Tchoukball, and Volleyball, during their PE classes.

 Apart from learning different sports and games, students acquire knowledge and skills in orienteering, outdoor cooking and camp craft through the Outdoor Education (OE) module. Through OE, our students develop an attitude of care and appreciation for the outdoor and environment. All Secondary 3 students are given the opportunity to participate and experience the MOE-Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) Challenge programme. The programme helps in developing the strengths in our students to overcome challenges in the outdoors and acquire life skills such as resilience and ruggedness.
