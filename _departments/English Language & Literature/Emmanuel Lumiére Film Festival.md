As part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) titled SPeak English with GrAce and Knowledge (SPEAK), six groups of selected Secondary 2 students embarked on a visual storyteller masterclass. The students produced short films exploring different school-based themes to tell compelling stories of love and empathy, amplifying the school’s student learning outcomes of **Fortitude, Mastery and Charity.**

  

The festival is named in memory of the late Brother Emmanuel, who had dedicated his life to serving the less fortunate - a fundamental belief of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, _“Those whom the world rejects, should move you the most.”_
