In Assumption English School, our Science teachers firmly believe that "Every student is creative" and "Every student is an innovator and a problem-solver". Apart from the traditionally strong and rigorous academic teaching and learning in class, the AES Lower Secondary Science curriculum enhance the learning experiences of the students by incorporating activities such as CSI (Creative Science Innovations / Investigations) and Science Experiential Projects (e.g: Water Filtration Project). Through these activities, we hope to promote interest, learning and creativity in Science through imaginative and enjoyable experiences.

Creative Science Innovations / Investigations (CSI)
---------------------------------------------------

  

In CSI, we aim to simulate our students’ curiosity by empowering them to either investigate and find out about the daily science phenomena that occurs around them or to come up with an innovative solutions to solve a problem that they faces. At the end of this project, students will have a chance to showcase their learning experiences and the fruits of their learning by creating a poster and presenting it to their fellow classmates and teachers.

  

The following reflection is done by a students at the end of the CSI Project:

  

_“I think that this project enable students to think more into real life situations and problems relating to the outside world. It also encourages me to think outside the box. Like how we are related to Singapore’s increased amount of food wastage. During this kind of lessons, I realized and discover my love for science.”_
