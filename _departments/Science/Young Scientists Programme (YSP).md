**Young Scientists Programme**, formerly named the **Scholars’ Programme**, was introduced in 2007. The Young Scientists Programme is a privileged programme that develops high-achieving Science students in critical thinking and problem solving, so as to prepare them to handle real-world problems of the 21st Century, through innovation and inquiry. Through the gargantuan of partnerships and collaborations with various educational institutions, the Young Scientists Programme seeks to provide exposure and substantial learning opportunities for its students in the area of Science.

  
### Our vision

  

A community of passionate, independent and self-directed leaders capable of empowering their peers towards academic achievement and being active contributors towards their community.

  

### Our mission
  

To provide a learning platform for our students to ignite their passion, stretch their critical thinking and problem-solving skills and extend their learning to science-related careers.

  

**_To achieve this mission, we engaged several strategies:_**

  

*   To develop students with the aptitude and attitude for Science
*   To provide opportunities for students to become active contributors who initiate and lead projects beyond the curriculum
*   To provide exposure through STRETCH programmes and competitions

  

### Leadership Framework of Young Scientists Programme

  
During this 3-year journey, we provide different platforms for them to serve and lead the school and community in the areas of science and technology.

As a budding YSP student, Ng Peng Yu Owen (class 2/1 of 2019) enjoyed what he has done this year.

  

_“In the Young Scientists Programme (YSP), we participated in the Hwa Chong Institution Science Research Projects Competition. Although it was tiring, but it was really exciting as we got to learn a lot more things than what we have learned during lessons in school. We built our very own dual axis solar tracker with the help of our mentor from Science Centre. In the process, we learnt about coding and wiring, how collecting accurate data and presenting our data. It is also our first time using a laser cutter to cut out acrylics for our prototype. The laser cutter is so cool as it is all controlled by the computer, even switching the laser cutter on and off.”_

  

Beside gaining scientific research skills and knowledge, Wong Qian Xin (class 3/2 of 2019) acquired soft skills while carrying out activities in YSP.

  

_“It has been an enjoyable journey for me to learn more about science rather than just reading from the textbook. For example, our own Science Read Programme allows me to share interesting science facts during morning assembly. This has also helps me to gain confidence to speak in front of people. As a YSP student committee member, I am glad to have more opportunities to improve my leadership skills through the activities that we organised.”_

  

  

Timothy Lee Mun Lok (class 4/1 of 2019) reflected back on his 3-year journey in the Young Scientists Programme.

  

_“I feel that the Young Scientists Programme (YSP) enables me to discover science outside of the textbook. I feel that the main event of my YSP journey is the Hwa Chong Institution Sabbatical programmes. It helped YSP students like me realise how science is applied outside of school and examinations. We learnt plenty of knowledge from different professionals. Aside from science, I learnt leadership and communication skills. When I started off as a member in Secondary 2, I was already seen as a "science leader". This is because we organised events and generated interesting science articles for the school as one YSP family. I definitely enjoyed being in YSP and I hope future YSP students will enjoy their experience in YSP like I did.”_
