Our vision is to develop gracious bilinguals with a strong Asian identity, through engaging learners in learning the language, values and culture through purposeful and meaningful Mother Tongue Language programmes.

Key Programmes
-------------------
#####  **MTL fortnight** <br>
AssumptionKnights learnt writing skills in the classroom by tapping on their experiences from learning journeys to cultural heritage sites or interactive enrichment cultural workshops. AssumptionKnights also had the opportunity to read out well wishes to their teachers in the Mother Tongue languages and dedicate songs sung in Chinese, Malay, Tamil, Hindi, Korean, Thai and even in French and German! AssumptionKnights also donated food items for our ‘Packing Love, Sharing Abundance’ in the annual Chinese New Year Food Donation Drive.

##### **Budding Writers and Language Ambassadors** <br>

Authors-in-Residence Programme allows our students to learn how to write creatively and effectively from well-known Chinese language authors.&nbsp;For the Malay language students, they are involved in the nation-wide Rakan Bahasa (Friends of the Language) initiative that enabled them to develop their skills in Malay. Students took part in a Teevers video-making competition where they created a news report video based on a given theme.
