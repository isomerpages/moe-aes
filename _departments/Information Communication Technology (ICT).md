**Vision** <br>
Teachers produce a safe and engaged environment with ICT, where students are immersed in responsible, self directed and collaborative learning.

  

**Goals** <br>
1\. Students use ICT pervasively in their learning process to develop 21st Century Competencies.

2\. Teachers to use ICT as a pedagogical and collaborative tool to engage the students who are digital natives.

3\. ICT is used as a tool for assessment, feedback, data collection, analysis and documentation.

  

In Assumption English School, we believe in an education that extends beyond the confines of content and knowledge within the formal academic curriculum. Information Communication Technology (ICT) plays an important role in enriching and transforming the learning environments of our students and equipping them with the critical competencies and dispositions to succeed in a knowledge economy.

  

In the classrooms, teachers employed various ICT and Web tools to enrich and extend the learning of students. Students are encouraged to work collaboratively with their peers, ask critical questions and explore possibilities beyond the textbooks through active use of technological tools in the classrooms. In turn, students are expected to discover learning and construct knowledge meaningfully for themselves. Students hone their existing ICT skills or learn new ones on the go as they prepare for projects and presentations.
