#### Nutrition and Food Science

The NFS unit aims to enhance the learning of nutrition and food science through meaningful activities that connect to real-life issues. Students participate in cooking competitions and attend food innovation workshops. The focus for the lower secondary students is for students to discover the importance of good nutrition through practical activities. While, the focus for upper secondary students is to deepen students’ application of food science and nutrition concepts through exploration, investigation and evaluation skills with real-world examples.
