The Humanities Department in AES uses authentic scenarios to bring about REAL and RELEVANT experiences for our learners. Lessons and projects done in class are designed using the Inquiry Model, allowing students to take on the hats of thoughtful Geographers, empathetic Historians and keen learners of Social Studies.&nbsp;

  

In the constantly evolving world, we continue to help our learners stay abreast with current affairs in our classrooms, leveraging on the use of technology to bring the world closer to our learners, encouraging open and active discussions on the issues that shape our world today, in the true spirit of Humanities learning.


### Key programmes

##### **Lower Secondary Geographical Investigation**

In Geography, the Lower Secondary students were able to meaningfully examine the rainforest environment in Dairy Farm Nature Park and conduct site observation surveys at Bangkit Housing Estate for their investigations. The Secondary Two fieldwork process culminated with the design of their ‘Dream Neighbourhood’, enabling them to use their creativity and imagination to work towards better quality of life and town sustainability in their proposed neighbourhoods.

##### **Lower Secondary Historical Investigation**
History came alive for the Lower Secondary students when they visited museums. The Secondary One students examined the lives of the immigrants from the early 1900s through their visit to the National Museum of Singapore, discovering the contributions and challenges of the early immigrants in Singapore. The immersive first-person views of the artefacts and exhibits also enabled the Secondary Two students to better understand the Japanese Occupation, and to empathise with the suffering that ensued during the visit to the Ford Factory of Singapore.

##### Upper Secondary Humanities 

 
The focus for the Upper Secondary levels was for the students to empathise with the different groups of people who lived during Hitler’s rule in History and also to evaluate if people with disabilities have sufficient support in Social Studies. Geography students also deepened their knowledge on Geography in Everyday Life by examining the physical-human interactions in the school campus and evaluating the school’s green efforts in combating climate change.


The students continued to use the Inquiry Model to guide their thought processes to articulate their opinions, whilst exercising empathy through active listening for other ideas too.

##### NT Social Studies

  

Social Studies is a subject that helps students explore real-world issues that concern them. Through inquiry learning, they explored issues such as living in a multicultural society, embracing migration, resolving conflict and building peace, maximising opportunities in a changing world and building a caring nation and an inclusive society. They also had the opportunity to apply what they have learnt through various Performance Tasks that helped to deepen their&nbsp; understanding of society and the world they live in.
