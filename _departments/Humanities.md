The Humanities Department in AES uses authentic scenarios to bring about REAL and RELEVANT experiences for our learners. Lessons and projects done in class are designed using the Inquiry Model, allowing students to take on the hats of thoughtful Geographers, empathetic Historians and keen learners of Social Studies.&nbsp;

  

In the constantly evolving world, we continue to help our learners stay abreast with current affairs in our classrooms, leveraging on the use of technology to bring the world closer to our learners, encouraging open and active discussions on the issues that shape our world today, in the true spirit of Humanities learning.


### Key programmes

##### **Lower Secondary Geographical Investigation**

  

Despite not being able to venture out of school due to COVID-19 precautionary measures, students and teachers leveraged on technological affordances to complete the performance tasks for NT Social Studies, as well as Lower Secondary Geographical and Historical investigations.&nbsp;

  

In Geography, the Secondary One and Two students were able to meaningfully examine the rainforest environments and housing estates in western parts of Singapore through the use of satellite imagery tools, such as Google Earth and Google Maps.
  

The authenticity of the fieldwork experiences was not compromised as the Secondary One students conducted their mini Geographical Investigation on the uses of green spaces in their neighbourhoods. Similarly, the Secondary Two students collaborated on digital platforms to propose improvements to a community space, in lieu of the safe distancing measures in this ‘new normal’.

On the other hand, History came “alive” for the Lower Secondary students when they “visited” museums virtually on their devices. The Secondary One students examined the lives of the immigrants from the early 1900s through a virtual museum created by the teachers, discovering the contributions and challenges of the early immigrants in Singapore. The immersive first-person virtual views of the artefacts and exhibits also enabled the Secondary Two students to better understand the Japanese Occupation, and to empathise with the suffering that ensued.  

  

“It seems like I was physically viewing the museum exhibits at the former Ford Factory. I learnt about the British’s surrender to the Japanese during World War 2.”&nbsp;\- He Xinliyi (Leo), Sec 2 student (2021)

**Lower Secondary Historical Investigation**

  

Using the Inquiry Model, students reviewed and collected artefacts through websites created to answer the inquiry questions posed.&nbsp;

  

The Secondary One students took a virtual trip to the National Museum of Singapore (NMS)&nbsp; to see what life was like in Singapore before 1942. The team of teachers created a website for the students to collect relevant artefacts while navigating through their SLS lessons. After which, the students were broken up into groups to create an artefact using platforms of their choice to present their perspectives of life in Singapore before 1942.&nbsp;

The Secondary Two students investigated what life was like during the Japanese Occupation on 8 March. As the museum trip was cancelled, the teachers recreated this experience by converting two rooms in school. Artefacts were put up, the rooms were decorated to simulate what a Japanese Occupation could be like, so that the students could empathise and understand life during that time. Students also used the iPads downloaded with the learning journey app to help them navigate through the artefacts.

**Upper Secondary Humanities**

  

The Upper Secondary Humanities focused on getting&nbsp; students to deepen their knowledge on the impact of the weather in their environment in Geography, empathise with the different groups of people who lived during Hitler’s rule in History and also to evaluate if the lower income groups have sufficient support in Social Studies.

**NT Social Studies**

  

Students learn about national identity, living in a diverse society, financial literacy and caring for society. They apply what they learn through various performance tasks, exhibiting their creativity.

**\- Exploring the Past, Present and Future of Public Housing in Singapore**

  

AssumptionKnights went through various station activities to discover the history and development of public housing in Singapore (History) and observe the characteristics of modern day HDB flats (Geography). Besides viewing still images and explanatory videos put up by the teachers, participants got the opportunity to put on VR goggles, experiencing first-hand how it may feel like to be inside a cramped living space&nbsp;[(“Life in a Coffin Home”)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhIQjyBrmwI)&nbsp;and around unhygienic living conditions&nbsp;[(“Dharavi Life 360VR”)](https://youtu.be/tOAvffXyRAs). After the immersive sensory experiences, AssumptionKnights were invited to envision their ideal housing types in view of current day housing challenges due to population growth and rising sea levels. The result? Creative floating homes and multi-purpose buildings with integrated uses to overcome scarce land space.
