### Vision

  

The Humanities Department in AES believes in using authentic scenarios to bring about REAL and RELEVANT experiences for our learners. In the constantly evolving COVID-19 pandemic world, we continue to strive towards providing a robust learning environment to help our learners stay abreast with current affairs in our classrooms. 

  

Lessons and projects done in class are designed using the Inquiry Model, allowing students to take on the hats of thoughtful Geographers, empathetic Historians and keen learners of Social Studies. Ultimately, we aim to leverage on the use of technology to bring the world closer to our learners, and for them to discuss openly and actively on the issues that shape our world today, in the true spirit of Humanities learning.

  

### Learning of Humanities in AES

**Lower Secondary Geographical Investigation**

  

Despite not being able to venture out of school due to COVID-19 precautionary measures, students and teachers leveraged on technological affordances to complete the performance tasks for NT Social Studies, as well as Lower Secondary Geographical and Historical investigations. 

  

In Geography, the Secondary One and Two students were able to meaningfully examine the rainforest environments and housing estates in western parts of Singapore through the use of satellite imagery tools, such as Google Earth and Google Maps.

  

The authenticity of the fieldwork experiences was not compromised as the Secondary One students conducted their mini Geographical Investigation on the uses of green spaces in their neighbourhoods. Similarly, the Secondary Two students collaborated on digital platforms to propose improvements to a community space, in lieu of the safe distancing measures in this ‘new normal’.
