We believe in imbuing students with an appreciation of mathematics and help them see the relevance of mathematics in their daily lives.  

  

Our signature programme gives students opportunities to go through a mathematical modelling process to build creative and collaborative skills. Students have to work in teams to solve authentic real-world problems or do experiments to obtain empirical data.

  

Secondary 1 students design and fly their kites to see whose kite stays in the air for the longest time while Secondary 2 students plan how to tile and renovate their bedroom (of a 5-room HDB flat) on a given budget.
