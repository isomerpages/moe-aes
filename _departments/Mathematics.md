Assumption English School mathematics teachers believe in imbuing students with an appreciation of mathematics and help them see the relevance of mathematics in their daily lives.

Our signature programme gives students opportunities to go through a mathematical modelling process to build creative and collaborative skills. Students have to work in teams to solve authentic real-world problems or do experiments to obtain empirical data.

The Secondary One students design, make and fly their own kite.

Student-centricity features strongly in our daily lessons; there are learning experiences to better engage students and enhance their mathematical concept development.

For example in Chapter 1, students learnt about prime numbers, prime factorisation, highest common factor (HCF) and lowest common multiple (LCM). With this, we leveraged on the Lunar New Year season and asked students to suggest the types of goodies to be included in a goodies bag. Thus, students did research by going online to ‘shop’ for goodies and decided on the goodies to be included. The teams that best met the criteria would be the winning team and the mathematics teacher packed that team’s goodies bag for the whole class.

The school provides support through weekly Booster Programme to support students who need extra help.

To stretch the more mathematically-inclined students, the school fields students for various external competitions.
