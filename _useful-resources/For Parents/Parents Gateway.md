Parents' Gateway is a mobile app developed by MOE and GovTech for closer engagement between parents and school. Parents can receive information and perform a range of administrative functions including giving consent for school activities and staying updated on schools' programmes.

  

Please download the app to your mobile devices (available in iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process using SingPass. For more information, you can view the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCM5o8jAncc) or visit the Parents’ Gateway website at [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)

  

To safeguard our students data, only parents/guardians who are registered in the official student records in the MOE database will be able to use the app to access the child's information.
