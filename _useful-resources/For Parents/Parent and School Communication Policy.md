**1\. Scope and Definition**

1.1. Communication between school and parent is an essential component of school life.  It is an intentional effort and a shared responsibility in order to provide support and to improve the ways students learn and develop.

1.2.  The school is committed to help and support you with sincerity and professionalism, and there must be mutual courtesy and respect.

**2\. School policies and procedures: new student and parent information**  

2.1.   Information for students and parents on school policies and procedures can be found in the student handbook

**3\. Curriculum and student related communication**

3.1.  During the beginning of the school year, the class teachers and the respective subject teachers will present the scope and sequence of the curriculum in individual subjects for the class to the students.

a. Information on methods and criteria of performance measurement will also be briefed to students.

b. Parents can direct queries to the relevant class/subject teachers through email (aes@moe.edu.sg).   

**4\. General school communication**

4.1.  The school informs the parents about current activities via the Parents’ Gateway and School Website. It is important that parents download the Parents’ Gateway and read and take note of announcements published.

4.2.  The AES general office will be the first point of contact for parents for non-educational questions.

4.3.  The following order of communication will be the basis for all communication between the school and the parents through the AES general office at 65729100:

a.  For all matters concerning the lessons, the respective subject teacher can be contacted; for general class matters, the form teacher can be contacted.

b.  Teachers are not expected to provide their personal mobile numbers to students or parents.

If a teacher shares their personal mobile number to a student, it is meant only for the student to communicate with the teacher on school matters.  The mobile number should not be shared without the teachers’ consent.

c.  Parents will receive a response to their email queries within three working days.

d. Generally, teachers and staff will not respond to emails after 5.00pm or on weekends unless this matter is an emergency in nature.

e.  If you wish to meet with a teacher, an appointment has to be made prior to the meeting.

4.4.  Communication should be gracious and respectful. The school owes a duty of care to its teachers and staff.  This is to protect them from intimidating or threatening behaviour in a verbal or written form. The school reserves the right not to engage parents under such circumstances.

**5\. Further Communication and Overview**

5.1.  Additional to the key communication means laid out above, AES aims to provide students and parents with further relevant information. An overview is provided in the following table:
