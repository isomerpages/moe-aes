Blended Learning provides an educational experience for our students through the seamless blending of different modes of learning. One aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of home-based learning (HBL) as a regular feature of the schooling experience.

**Student Initiated Learning:**  
Students will embark on Students Initiated Learning (SIL) on Blended Learning days. Students have a choice in what they would like to learn within the curated semestral themes. Students will document and share their learning on their students’ e-portfolio Google site, which will be useful to showcase their learning and achievement to potential employers or interviewers when applying for higher education institutions.
