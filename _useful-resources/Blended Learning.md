Dear Parent/ Guardian,  
  
Greetings from Assumption English School.  
  
Blended Learning provides an educational experience for our students through the seamless blending of different modes of learning. One aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of home-based learning (HBL) as a regular feature of the schooling experience.  
  
**Objectives of Blended Learning:**  
• To nurture self-directed and independent learners as they explore concepts and conduct research.  
• To equip our students with stronger abilities, dispositions and habits for independent and lifelong learning.  
• To develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.  
• To deepen digital literacies in learners.  
• To develop learners who can apply knowledge of cyber wellness and cyber security to safeguard their online learning.  
  
AES will be embarking on Blended Learning every fortnight.  
  
**Please see the confirmed Blended Learning dates for 2023:**

**Student Initiated Learning:**  
Students will embark on Students Initiated Learning (SIL) on Blended Learning days. Students have a choice in what they would like to learn within the curated semestral themes. Students will document and share their learning on their students’ e-portfolio Google site, which will be useful to showcase their learning and achievement to potential employers or interviewers when applying for higher education institutions.  
  
**These are the curated themes for Semester 1:**
