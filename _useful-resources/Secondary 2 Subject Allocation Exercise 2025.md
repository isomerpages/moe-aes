<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>Before your child/ward chooses his/her Secondary Three subject combination,

that students will be taking for the National Examinations, their future
entry to courses offered by Post-Secondary Educational Institutions and
their future career choices.</p>
<p>Subjects are offered based on academic merit (which includes overall performance
and subject performance subject combinations), class size and based on
school professional judgement.</p>
