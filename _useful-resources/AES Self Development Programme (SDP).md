AES Self-Development Programme is our signature programme offered to **Secondary 1 N(A), 1 N(T), 2 N(A) and 2 N(T) non-SBB and 2 E students**. It provides these students the choice and opportunity to access and study Lower Secondary Science, Humanities, English, Literature or Mathematics subject at a more demanding level.

The AES SDP students will have to go through a period of 2 to 6 months of self-directed online learning programme (Part 1 & 2) which requires about 1 to 2 hours a week per subject to complete the **lesson packages and the self-assessment quizzes**. A guide will be provided to navigate the learning resources in the respective **online curriculum sites**.

  

**The objectives of AES SDP:**

*   To encourage students to be **independent and self-directed learners**.
*   To recognise the **strengths and interests** of our students, to **build their confidence** and **develop an intrinsic motivation** to learn for life in them.
*   To stretch their learning in the area of **Science, Humanities, Mathematics and English Language.**

▪ Sec 2 Express students can explore 2 taster chapters of Upper Secondary Sciences and Additional Mathematics to have a better understanding what these subjects entail.

In deciding whether to take up the AES SDP, students and their parents should consider the student’s aptitude and interest in the Science, Humanities, Mathematics and English as well as their ability to cope with the other subjects.
