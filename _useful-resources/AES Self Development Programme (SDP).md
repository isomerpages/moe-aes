AES Self-Development Programme is our signature&nbsp;programme&nbsp;offered to&nbsp;**Secondary 1 N(A), 1 N(T), 2 N(A) and 2 N(T) non-SBB and 2 E students**. It provides these students the choice and opportunity to access and study Lower Secondary Science, Humanities, English, Literature or Mathematics&nbsp;subject at a more demanding level.

The AES&nbsp;SDP&nbsp;students will have to go through a period of 2 to 6 months of self-directed online learning programme (Part 1 &amp; 2) which requires about 1 to 2 hours a week per subject to complete the&nbsp;**lesson packages and the self-assessment quizzes**. A guide will be provided to navigate the learning resources in the respective&nbsp;**online curriculum sites**.

  

**<u>The objectives of AES&nbsp;SDP:</u>**

*   To encourage students to be&nbsp;**independent and self-directed learners**.
*   To recognise the&nbsp;**strengths and interests**&nbsp;of our students, to&nbsp;**build their confidence**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**develop an intrinsic motivation**&nbsp;to learn for life in them.
*   To stretch their learning in the area of&nbsp;**Science, Humanities, Mathematics and English Language.**

▪ Sec 2 Express students can explore 2 taster chapters of Upper Secondary&nbsp;Sciences and Additional Mathematics to have a better&nbsp;understanding what these subjects entail.

▪ To help students make good and informed decisions before&nbsp;the Subject Allocation Exercise.

In deciding whether to take up the AES SDP, students and their&nbsp;parents should consider the student’s aptitude and interest in&nbsp;the Science, Humanities, Mathematics and English as well as&nbsp;their ability to cope with the other subjects.
