Dear Parents and Guardians, <br>
Please refer to the parent's letter attached for the details on the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP).

[NDLP\_Parents letter.pdf](/files/NDLP_Parents%20letter.pdf)

You child/ward would have received the hard copy of the letter from his/her form teacher this morning. Please take some time to read through it and respond accordingly.

From 2022, students will purchase the 11.6” Acer Chromebook Spin R752TN as the school-prescribed PLD. This device is a touchscreen convertible laptop (i.e. can be used as a laptop or rotated 180 degrees into a tablet) and comes with its own in-built stylus for inking functions.

Device cost is S$509.30 and price includes 3-year insurance & warranty.

To proceed with the purchase of the PLD, please fill in the online form at this link: [https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin) by 11 February 2022 (Friday). Singpass will be required for this online form. If you are unable to submit the form online, please obtain a hardcopy version from the school’s General Office.

These parent handbooks share more information on how owning a personal learning device will enhance the child’s learning as well as some digital parenting tips, strategies and resources.
