Dear Parents and Guardians,

Please refer to the parent's letter attached for the details on the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP).


[NDLP - Letter to Parents for PDLP Procurement](/files/NDLP%20-%20Letter%20to%20Parents%20for%20PDLP%20Procurement.pdf)

You child/ward would have received the hard copy of the letter from his/her form teacher on 27 January 2023. Please take some time to read through it and respond accordingly.

From 2023, students will purchase the 11.6” Acer Chromebook Spin R753TN as the school-prescribed PLD. This device is a touchscreen convertible laptop (i.e. can be used as a laptop or rotated 180 degrees into a tablet) and comes with its own in-built stylus for inking functions.

Device cost is S$564.80 and price includes 3-year insurance & warranty.

To proceed with the purchase of the PLD, please fill in the online form at this link: [https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin) by 3 February 2023 (Friday). Singpass will be required for this online form. If you are unable to submit the form online, please obtain a hardcopy version from the school’s General Office.

These parent handbooks share more information on how owning a personal learning device will enhance the child’s learning as well as some digital parenting tips, strategies and resources.
