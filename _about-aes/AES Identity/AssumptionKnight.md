<h4><u>The AssumptionKnight</u></h4>
<p>The AssumptionKnight serves as the official mascot of Assumption English
School, representing the core student outcomes of Fortitude, Mastery, and
Charity. All students of AES are affectionately referred to as AssumptionKnights,
a title that reflects both their identity and aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The AssumptionKnight comprises three symbolic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Cape</strong> represents taking flight for adventure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Shield</strong> of Faith is guarded by strong beliefs and values;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Sword</strong> is a symbol of knighthood, chivalry, strength,
courage and leadership.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secondary 1 Orientation programme culminates in the Knighting Ceremony,
where each student receives a mascot with a<strong> cape</strong>. This
symbolises the start of their journey as a member of the AES community,
ready to soar.</p>
<p>At Secondary 2, students receive the <strong>Shield of Faith</strong>.
This emblem represents their deepening strong beliefs and embodiment of
school values, firmly rooted in the Montfortian Ethos.</p>
<p>As they enter Secondary 3, each student is presented with the <strong>sword</strong>.
This symbolises their significant growth and development, marking their
emergence as leaders in their unique ways as AssumptionKnights.</p>
<p>By Secondary 4 and 5, every student has blossomed into a <strong>fully equipped AssumptionKnight</strong>.
They embody the core student outcomes of <strong>Fortitude, Mastery, and Charity</strong>,
emerging as men and women of strong character and deep learning, poised
to contribute and serve the community.</p>
