<p style="text-align:center;">Once more unite our youthful voices,<br>Amidst our halls the strains to raise,<br>With rapid swell the heart rejoices,<br>When Virtue is the theme of praise,<br>We follow those who have trodden uprightly,<br>As well in sunshine as in rain,<br>Pupils old and new we do fashion so tightly,<br>Enduring links of one long chain.<br><br>Chorus:<br><em>We pupils of Assumption English School,<br>When God from on High sheds his light on our way,<br>We, pupils of Assumption English School,<br>The White and Blue shall be known far and wide,<br>The White and the Blue, the White and the Blue,<br>Shall be ever Boys’ Town’s pride</em><br><br>We love our Alma Mater dearly,<br>For all the blessings so rightly given,<br>The lessons she has taught so clearly,<br>The ceaseless care with which she has striven,<br>In white and blue in words we pen,<br>Our tender hearts with emotion are beating,<br>In joy and grief in the life that is fleeting,<br>Assumption, Boys' Town shall ever stand!<p>
