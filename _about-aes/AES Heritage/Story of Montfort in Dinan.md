<p>Inspired by our Spiritual Founder St. Louis Marie de Montfort, AES uses
stories from his life to encourage AssumptionKnights</p>

<p>One night while returning from a mission in Dinan, Louis Marie found a
poor and sick man all covered with sores on the street.</p>
<p>He carried him on his back and brought him to the mission house. The door
keeper of the house where he stayed was very much astonished to hear him
knock at the door one night and cry aloud several times: “Open to Jesus
Christ!”</p>

<p>He took the sick man to his own room, laid him on his bed and spent the
night either praying or warming and nursing the sick man. Louis Marie saw
in the poor the person of God Himself.</p>
<p>This story reminds AssumptionKnights to serve the lost, the last and the
least, by lending a helping hand to those in need whenever they can.</p>
<p>“Those whom the world rejects must move you the most.”</p>
