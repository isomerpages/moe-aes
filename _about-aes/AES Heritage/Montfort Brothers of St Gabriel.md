<p>The Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel linked their foundation to St. Louis
Marie de Montfort (1673 – 1716) in France. The first Brothers were associated
with the founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, and assisted him in his
missionary preaching in the western part of France. In the course of his
mission in those parts of France, St. Louis Marie de Montfort established
charitable schools for needy children. He entrusted this work to the early
followers, from whom the group grew to be later known as the Montfort Brothers
of St. Gabriel.</p>
<p>The Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel arrived in Singapore at the end of
1936. They took over the running of Holy Innocent English School (later
on known as Montfort School) in 1937 at the invitation of the late Bishop
Deval. The mission in Singapore grew and flourished and today we have the
Montfort Junior and Secondary Schools; the Boys’ Town, which include the
Boys’ Town Home, the Assumption Pathway School and the Assumption English
School; and the St. Gabriel’s Primary and Secondary Schools.</p>

<p>Today there are no longer any Brothers directly teaching in the school
but the spirit of the founder continues among the many lay personnel of
the schools and institution. The St. Gabriel’s Foundation (SGF) established
in 2001 constituting of lay members and Brothers now governs the schools
and institution in the spirit of the founder St. Louis Marie de Montfort
as emulated by the early founding Brothers.</p>
