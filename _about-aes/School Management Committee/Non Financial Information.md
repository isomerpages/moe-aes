**Objectives:**  
Assumption English School is a government-aided school founded by the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. The school is one of the seven Gabrielite institutions in Singapore and many others in 33 countries worldwide. The school subscribes to the Montfortian Education Charter which serves as a guide to 'form enlightened and harmonious persons committed to a just and fraternal world'. Thus the school's&nbsp; philosophy is that 'We believe that Education is a journey of Self Discovery where students discover their talents, clarify their values &amp; form their moral compass.' The school creates an ethos that cares and challenges our students to become Learners and Leaders who demonstrate Fortitude, Mastery and Charity. The school motto, Labor Omnia Vincit, sums it up clearly - our students will, through work, achieve success.  
  
Our School Motto "Age Quod Agis" translates to "Do Well in Whatever you Do". It reminds our boys of the dignity of work and that the work they do is important, and represents who they are.&nbsp; Therefore, they need to take pride in their assigned tasks and do them to the best of their abilities. Our School Values are Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Service, Team Spirit &amp; Excellence - together they spell CHRISTE which also represents our faith in God and Christ.  
  

**Vision:** <br>
Men and Women of Character and Learning, in the Service of God and Community

  

**Mission:** <br>
To educate the whole person in the Montfortian spirit of learning, charity and love.&nbsp; 

**Programs/Activities:** <br>
To realise the school's vision to produce 'Men and Women of Character and Learning, in the Service of God and Community', the school's Montfortian Achievers' Programme and range of Co-Curricular Activities provide valuable opportunities for students to develop self-confidence, self-discipline and social-emotional competencies through experiential learning and Values-in-Action projects in the school and community. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), SPEAK (**SP**eak&nbsp;**E**nglish with gr**A**ce and&nbsp;**K**nowledge), aims to develop a love and appreciation for the English Language, and hone students' language ability so that they are effective and proficient users of the language. Through the ALP, students will gain mastery of the language through specialised training such as poetry and drama, debate, drama and public speaking, with opportunities to apply their skills through competitions, events and attachments. The school's learning for life Programme (LLP) named DINAN Leadership Programme aims to inculcate school and national values, 21CC and develop servant leadership skills and competencies through science and environmental inquiry-based learning and purposeful values-in-action activities (VIA). Our students learn to articulate, reflect and advocate the self-leadership and mastery, as well as the school's CHRIST values of Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Sense of Responsibility and Trust through a 3-tiered developmental approach by Leading to Serve, Serving to Lead and Leading to Inspire.&nbsp;
