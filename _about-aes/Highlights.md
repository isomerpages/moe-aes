**<u>National Day Celebration - Together, Our Singapore Spirit</u>**

  

This year’s NDP theme is ‘Together Our Singapore Spirit’ 

  

‘Together’ evokes our common Singapore identity and Singaporeans coming together as one united people.

  

‘Our Singapore Spirit’ calls on Singaporeans to draw new strength from our “can-do” spirit amidst challenging circumstances from COVID-19 and potential disruptions in the new decade. We look to reinvigorate the Singapore Spirit - encouraging Singaporeans to embrace a “dare-to-try” attitude, and reinvent to overturn our natural and geographical constraints.

**<u>NS Engagement / SAF Day 2021</u>**

This year, we invited some of our staff to share their experiences when serving NS. Some have also shared their experiences as parents, when their sons served NS.

**<u>Racial Harmony Day - Common Spaces, Connected Communities</u>**

  

Made of hexagonal cells, a honeycomb is built by honey bees to contain larvae and store honey & pollen. The hexagonal shape of the cells give the honeycomb added strength, and allow the cells to be connected easily – Connected communities.

  

Hence our AssumptionKnights designed their own honeycombs and we have joined some of their work together to form our AES Honeycomb!

Back by popular demand, the Coffee of my Eye activity allows AssumptionKnights to pen down and share their narratives, stories of friendships that they treasure. 

  

Here are some of the submissions:
