Our theme for this year, “AssumptionKnight Unite and Celebrate” captures 70 years of our school history. The school has come a long way, providing a progressive secondary school curriculum which is innovative and forward looking. At the same time, the education landscape has evolved where our students learn for the intrinsic joy of acquiring new knowledge and skills, rather than for exams. At the same time, there is also a premium placed on inculcating good values in our students, and for them to make sound decisions that contribute to others and society. And as a Catholic Mission School, we are well placed to provide that educational experience to produce men and women of character and learning in the service of God and the community.  

I am heartened that Assumption English School (AES) has been at the forefront of change.  Such as we were in the first phase of 28 schools that piloted the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) initiative in 2020.

At the same time, the school value added to the FSBB initiative by establishing our own Self Development Programme (SDP) to complement FSBB. The SDP is aimed at students who are not eligible for the FSBB, to provide these students with access to more demanding subjects. The SDP encourages our students to have greater ownership of their learning by leveraging on their personal learning device and online resources that are specially created and curated by our teachers to extend their learning based on their choice. Therefore, our lower secondary Normal stream students have the option to choose higher demanding subjects which are non-examinable, such as English, Mathematics, Science, the Humanities including Literature, based on their own interest. The SDP is a fascinating initiative in which students make choices, learn at their own pace, and in their own time.

For our secondary two Express stream students, like the SDP, they can learn at their own pace and time and try out “taster modules” of Additional Mathematics and Upper Secondary Sciences using their personal learning devices and online resources. This will engage and spur their interest to help them make informed choices about their subject-combination at secondary three.

We also have the privilege to participate in the Football Association of Singapore’s "Unleash the Roar" programme as a school football academy. We are grateful for the three full-time coaches dedicated to the training of our students. Furthermore, there is also specialized goalkeeper training and sports science support to monitor the progress of our students. Thanks to such comprehensive support from FAS, we can deploy our resources to strengthen our other school and CCA programmes.

Our character and values education is inspired by Saint Louis Marie de Montfort, the founding Father of our mission. The stories of Montfort at Dinan, Renne, Poitier and Cesson are anchored to our level themes and is taught progressively from Secondary One to Five. Montfort's life contains valuable lessons that teach us to honour the last, lost and the least; to act and make a difference to the lives of others, especially those who are marginalized. Montfort also teaches us to pursue our goals resolutely and courageously by serving and helping others. The belief that "Those whom the rejects must move you the most” continues to give teachers, staff, and students an ever-growing sense of purpose.

As we move forward as a school, we trust in the loving hands of God that guide us to bring out the best in our students and ourselves.

Labor Omnia Vincit

AssumptionKnights Unite!
