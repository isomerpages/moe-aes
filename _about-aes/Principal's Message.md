<p>We are delighted to welcome everyone back as we extend a warm greeting
to our new students joining the AES community!</p>
<p>As a Catholic mission school, we hold firmly to the belief that character
development lies at the heart of education. Drawing inspiration from our
founding figure, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, we are called to serve others
with purpose. Our CHRIST values—Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity,
Sense of Responsibility, and Trust—guide our students as they grow stronger
and learn to lead lives that honour both personal achievement and the wellbeing
of others. We strive to help each student discover their unique gifts and
work together towards the greater good.</p>
<p>This year's theme, "<strong>Stronger Together – Called to Learn, Lead and Love</strong>,"
captures what makes secondary school education such a memorable and enriching
phase of life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Called to Learn</u></strong>
<br>Every student possesses the capacity to learn and excel in their studies.
With curiosity and purposeful effort, learning becomes both enjoyable and
deeply rewarding.</p>
<p>We are therefore committed to preparing every student for the future through
our forward-looking curriculum in a technology-enhanced environment. Students
build confidence through our SPEAK Applied Learning Programme, where they
are given opportunities to present across various platforms. Our curriculum
is thoughtfully designed to develop 21st Century Skills and Competencies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Called to Lead</u></strong>
<br>Every student has the opportunity to make daily choices that bring about
positive differences in others' lives.</p>
<p>Embracing Montfort's spirit, we nurture adaptable leaders who genuinely
desire to serve and create meaningful impact. The AES Dinan Leadership
Programme provides students with opportunities to develop their leadership
capabilities through service learning.</p>
<p>Students also build international friendships through our annual Asian
Young Leaders for Human Fraternity (AYLHF) programme. &nbsp;Students from
Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia come together every year to celebrate
cultural diversity and explore how we can work towards a better world for
all.</p>
<p><strong><u>Called to Love</u></strong>
<br>Above all, God calls us to love.</p>
<p>The Montfort Stories accompany each cohort throughout their AES journey,
inspiring them to develop a heart for the Last, the Lost, and the Least.
Through these experiences, students have opportunities to serve and draw
closer to the purposes God has called them to in life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stronger Together</u></strong>
<br><strong>"</strong>And though one might prevail against another, two will
withstand one. <strong>A threefold cord is not quickly broken</strong>."
- Ecclesiastes 4:12</p>
<p>Indeed, AssumptionKnights embrace the mission of caring for and supporting
one another throughout their secondary school years.</p>
<p>It is through the love and unwavering support of our stakeholders and
parents that the school continues to flourish, growing from strength to
strength as a school of choice in the West.</p>
<p>All glory be to God!</p>
