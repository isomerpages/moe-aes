Our theme for this year, "A Thriving AES, Strengthen Roots, Growing Green Shoots” is appropriate as we build up our identity, school culture, school programmes and partnership. It is a theme that provides us with the foundation to nurture new strengths as we leverage on technology to drive our curriculum, pedagogy, CCA and overall well- being. We do all these while maintaining greater awareness on environmental sustainability. We have continued to innovate in the midst of disruption and are well poised to provide a forward looking teaching and learning experience for our students.  

As a pilot school for Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) since 2020, our students have adjusted well in an inclusive learning environment where the lines that divide the different streams have become blurred. As a result, students demonstrate greater drive, spontaneity and respect for each other at school. Students in the Normal stream who are eligible to access subjects at a more demanding level are also able to stretch and strengthen their skills and knowledge in subjects that they have a strong interest in.  

Complementing the FSBB, the school launched the Self Development Programme (SDP) which is an AES initiative. The SDP allows our lower secondary Normal stream students who do not qualify for FSBB to embark on their own journey of learning at a more challenging level by tapping on their personal learning devices and the school’s online teaching and learning resources. While the programme supports and enhances the curriculum, it does not entail formal assessment. Students therefore extends their own learning while remaining independent in seeking new knowledge at their comfort level. The programme currently supports the English Language, Mathematics, Science and Humanities subjects.

Secondary Two Express students will also have the opportunity of being supported by a slightly modified version of the SDP where they have access to specially curated upper secondary Science and Additional Mathematics curricula leveraging on their personal learning devices and online resources. This will consequently enable the students to make better informed choices of the subject combination they may want to pursue at upper secondary levels. Hence, we are leveraging on technology to empower students in making choices, learning according to their own interests and at their own pace.

Our character and values education is inspired by Saint Louis Marie de Montfort, the founding Father of our mission. The stories of Montfort at Dinan, Renne, Poitier and Cesson are anchored to our level themes and is taught progressively from Secondary One to Five. Montfort's life contains valuable lessons that teaches us to honour the last, lost and the least; to take action and make a difference to the lives of others, especially those who are rejected by society. Finally, Montfort also teaches us to pursue our goals resolutely and courageously by serving and helping others. Underlying all of it is the belief that it should be "less about oneself and more for others".

As we go forward as a school, we believe in the loving hands of God that guide us, that His mercy will preserve us as we bring out the best in our students and ourselves.
