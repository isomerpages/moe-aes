### Direct School Admission (DSA)

Dear Parents/Guardians and Primary 6 students,

Assumption English School (AES) will be offering Direct School Admission in the following areas of talent:

*   Basketball (Girls & Boys)

We invite students who wish to grow their talent and passion in these areas to become a part of our AES family in 2025.
