<p><strong>About Boys' Town</strong>
</p>
<p>Boys’ Town is a charitable institution by the Montfort Brothers of St
Gabriel. It is a unique Catholic institution dedicated to providing guidance,
shelter, education, vocational training and practical living skills to
youths from disadvantaged and disengaged families. The collections on this
Flag Day will go towards the programmes and improvement of facilities in
Boys’ Town.</p>
<p><strong>AES supports Boys’ Town Flag Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Through their participation in this project, Assumptionknights will develop
a sense of compassion for those in need. They will be able to experience
the spirit of charity and to put community before self. This will also
be an opportunity for students to acquire and apply presentation and communication
skills, as they will be interacting with members of the public in seeking
their contributions. We strongly believe that this experience will build
confidence in all our students, and at the same time, allow them to empathise
with others and exercise humility.</p>
<p>As a school of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel’s, AES is committed
to offer its full support to a fellow institution of the same organisation.allowfullscreen="true"&gt;</p>
