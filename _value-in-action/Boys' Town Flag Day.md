#### Objectives

  

To instil in students a sense of compassion for those in need (raise funds for a good cause).

To equip students with presentation and communication skills in approaching members of the public with requests (for a donation).



**About Boys' Town**

  

Boys’ Town is a charitable institution by the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel. It is a unique Catholic institution dedicated to providing guidance, shelter, education, vocational training and practical living skills to youths from disadvantaged and disengaged families. The collections on this Flag Day will go towards the programmes and improvement of facilities in Boys’ Town.

**AES supports Boys’ Town Flag Day**

  

Through their participation in this project, Assumptionknights will develop a sense of compassion for those in need. They will be able to experience the spirit of charity and to put community before self. This will also be an opportunity for students to acquire and apply presentation and communication skills, as they will be interacting with members of the public in seeking their contributions. We strongly believe that this experience will build confidence in all our students, and at the same time, allow them to empathise with others and exercise humility.

  

As a school of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel’s, AES is committed to offer its full support to a fellow institution of the same organisation.
