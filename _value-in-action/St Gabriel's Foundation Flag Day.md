#### About Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel

  

The religious congregation of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel is a Catholic organisation which has been in Singapore since 1936. Since their arrival, seven institutions have been established, namely, Assumption English School, Assumption Pathway School, Boys’ Town, Montfort Junior School, Montfort Secondary School, St Gabriel’s Primary School and St Gabriel’s Secondary School.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

Initially, most of these institutions were set up to provide education to the poor and under privileged.&nbsp; Evolving with needs of society, these seven institutions today continue to cater to those whom the world rejects and those who desire a good Catholic education. This is expressed mainly through the Montfort Education Charter (MEC).

  
#### AES supports St Gabriel’s Foundation Flag Day

  

To fully implement the Montfortian Education Charter in the various institutions, St. Gabriel’s Foundation need to rely on fund raising as most of the projects undertaken are not considered as standard activities funded by MOE. Hence, the foundation needs to appeal to the generosity of the members of public to raise funds for the foundation.  

  

As a school of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel’s, AES is committed to offer its full support to a fellow institution of the same organisation.
