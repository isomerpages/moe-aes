Students will conduct research on a given environmental theme. Based on the theme, they will create artefacts, such as posters, useful items made through upcycling of waste materials and games to engage their peers on an environment cause. This is linked to the CHRIST values of compassion, humility and exercising the students’ sense of responsibility towards the school environment. Students will also advocate good environmental practices to their peers.
