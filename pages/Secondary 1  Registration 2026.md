<h4><strong>A Warm Welcome to all our 2026 Sec 1 Students and Parents!</strong></h4>
<p>Congratulations on your posting to Assumption English School (AES) to
begin your secondary school education. This is an exciting new phase of
your education journey and we are happy to welcome you to our AES family.
We are excited to meet all of you in 2026.</p>
<p>Get ready to embark on this meaningful journey as an up and coming AssumptionKnight.
To help you get started, we have provided some information to enable you
to have a smooth and seamless transition to Secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Registration Information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Secondary 1 Registration Exercise will be conducted <strong>via Parents Gateway.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>*** Please note that Parents Gateway will be undergoing maintenance on 19 December from 12.00pm – 5.00pm. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Students <strong><u>are not required</u></strong> to report to Assumption
English School for registration.</p>
<p>Parents will receive a notification together with an <a href="/files/Sec_1_Registration_Info_Kit_2026.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">information kit</a> via
Parents Gateway with further details on the registration process.</p>
<p>The first day of school will be on <strong>2 January 2026 (Friday)</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-Based Banding (SBB) Information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For students who qualify to take subjects at a more demanding level, the
school will send a letter of offer via Parents Gateway by <strong>23 December 2025</strong>,
for the following programmes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Full Subject-Based Banding for G1 and G2 students</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligible students may be offered one or more subjects at a more demanding
level. Eligibility will be based on the Achievement Level (AL) score obtained
for the corresponding PSLE subject.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Higher Mother Tongue for G3 students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third Language for G2 and G3 students</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents are required to respond to the notification on Parents Gateway
to accept or decline the offer. This will allow the school to assign your
child to the appropriate Secondary 1 teaching group.</p>
<p>You may use the information provided in the notification, together with
your response, to select and purchase the appropriate textbooks and learning
materials. Please ensure that materials are purchased according to the
subject level that your child will be studying.</p>

on the following criteria.</p>

actual cut-off point (COP) of the current year's S1 Posting.&nbsp;</p>
