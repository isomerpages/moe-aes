</u></strong></p>

Objectives

Our Basketball, Football and Judo school teams embarked on a sport training cum cultural school immersion tour to Johor (Malaysia) from 30 Aug – 1 Sep 2019 (Fri – Sun). The contingent of 59 student-athletes, 6 teachers and 3 coaches went on this tour with the following objectives:  

  

1.  To provide our student athletes the opportunity to train, learn and work together as a team.
2.  To interact and learn from youths from a different country and culture.
3.  To develop the leadership competencies of our athletes.

  

Highlights
----------

  

During the tour, our students experienced cultural school immersion with Foon Yew High School (Kulai) where they visited the school and interacted with the teachers to learn more about Malaysian schools educational system and their curriculum. Thereafter, our Basketball (Boys & Girls) and Football (Boys) teams interacted and played friendly games against Foon Yew High School’s Basketball and Football school team. It was a valuable experience for our basketballers and footballers as they learnt through the friendly games and forged friendship with students of Foon Yew High School.

  

The basketballers and footballers also played friendly games against Dian Feng Basketball Club and Pasir Gudang Football Academy respectively. Our Judokas took the opportunity to train at the Master Jin Martial Arts Academy under the supervision of qualified Judo coaches.

  

Our Assumptionknights had the opportunity to visit Kota Iskandar, Johor as part of their cultural immersion during the tour. They visited the Sultan Ismail Building which is the meeting place for the Johor State Legislative Assembly. The architecture was a distinctive blend of Moorish-Andalusian and Johor-Malay design. There were 2 distinctive skylights of a diamond and pineapple, which are symbols of Johor economic prosperity. The State Legislative Assembly Hall is Malaysia’s first Parliament that is open to the public. Integrated within the hall of the building are symbolisms of Johor’s past and bright future such as the black pepper motifs as well as the lush gardens of Musk Lime Garden and Potpourri Garden. The visit was an insightful learning of the Johor State Administrative Centre, history and development of Johor.

  

Looking Forward

The tour has enriched our athletes’ learning experiences in their chosen sports and a better understanding of the Malaysian culture. Through the friendly games of playing against stronger teams, our athletes learnt to be a better player. In the process, they have bonded as a team, fostering greater team spirit.
