<p>At AES, we believe education is a journey of self-discovery where students
discover their interests, strengths and talents. Our various school programmes
are designed to stretch students in different areas. AES is also one of
the only few schools in the region continuing to offer Triple Science as
an Upper Secondary subject combination.&nbsp;</p>
