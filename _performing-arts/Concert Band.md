<h3>Reflections from Graduating Seniors (2024)</h3>
<p><strong>Nicole Tan (4/2) - Band Major</strong>
<br>As a Band Major, it was tough, especially when I have little experience
in leadership. It took me a while to adapt and familiarize myself with
the role. With the help of my seniors, I was able to manage and discipline
the band. I learnt to balance my responsibilities of running the band and
supporting my fellow band members. This experience has taught me the importance
of teamwork and dedication. Hence, I am grateful for this opportunity given
to me.</p>
<p><strong>Chan Rae Ann (4/2) - Secretary</strong> 
<br>As the Band secretary, I oversee the attendance for the band. However,
it was not always easy because it may be difficult to get my peers’ attention.
I sought help from teachers, instructors and the other leaders. They helped
and guided me along the way. During my band journey, I learnt that we can
always rely on one another to help when we need it. I learnt the importance
of working as a team and being respectful to everyone to create a kind
and caring band environment. I am extremely grateful to the teachers, leaders,
and Mr. Joseph for supporting me throughout my entire band journey and
for the experience of being a leader as it has taught me important values
as a person.</p>
<p><strong>Lucus Wong (4/6) - Percussion Section Leader</strong> 
<br>Being a leader is not an easy role. During my band sessions, my section
mates may not consistently be able to cooperate with me and follow my instructions.
As time went by, I could get my section to cooperate well using different
methods of instructions. I am glad to have this experience as a leader
in a band. The role has taught me patience. Although it takes a lot of
time and effort, the band will improve and do better for future performance.</p>
