### Reflections from Graduating Seniors (2024)

**Nicole Tan (4/2) - Band Major**<br>
As a Band Major, it was tough, especially when I have little experience in leadership. It took me a while to adapt and familiarize myself with the role. With the help of my seniors, I was able to manage and discipline the band. I learnt to balance my responsibilities of running the band and supporting my fellow band members. This experience has taught me the importance of teamwork and dedication. Hence, I am grateful for this opportunity given to me.

  

**Chan Rae Ann (4/2) - Secretary** <br>
As the Band secretary, I oversee the attendance for the band. However, it was not always easy because it may be difficult to get my peers’ attention. I sought help from teachers, instructors and the other leaders. They helped and guided me along the way. During my band journey, I learnt that we can always rely on one another to help when we need it. I learnt the importance of working as a team and being respectful to everyone to create a kind and caring band environment. I am extremely grateful to the teachers, leaders, and Mr. Joseph for supporting me throughout my entire band journey and for the experience of being a leader as it has taught me important values as a person.

**Lucus Wong (4/6) - Percussion Section Leader** <br>
Being a leader is not an easy role. During my band sessions, my section mates may not consistently be able to cooperate with me and follow my instructions. As time went by, I could get my section to cooperate well using different methods of instructions. I am glad to have this experience as a leader in a band. The role has taught me patience. Although it takes a lot of time and effort, the band will improve and do better for future performance.
