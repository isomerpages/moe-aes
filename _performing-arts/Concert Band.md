####   **Reflections from our graduating seniors, Class of 2022:**

  

**NEO AN JUN - Band Major (4/5)** <br>
Over the years, I have learnt many values such as responsibility, patience and resilience through the help of the band itself, my seniors, instructors, teachers and friends. My band experience has truly been pleasant and I really enjoyed my four years of being in a band.

  

**NUR RIDWAN BIN RAMLAN - Drum Major (4/3)** <br>
Personally, I believe that band has given me the opportunity to hone my leadership skills as a Drum Major. I live by the phrase “One Band, One Sound” as being part of a band requires teamwork. I am thankful that I got to be a part of the AES Band.

**OLIVER SALIKIN LAMBERT WAIRISAL - Student Conductor (4/6)**  <br>
I feel good as I learn the different percussion instruments in Band. I wanted to try all these types of instruments even though I do not know how to play some of the instruments before. With the help of Mr Joseph and Miss Chua, I managed to pick up skills to play most of the percussion instruments. It was a great privilege to perform during SYF and a privilege to become a student conductor. These two things made me realize that teamwork and responsibility is key to make a band great!
