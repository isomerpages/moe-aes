<h4><strong>Write ups from our very own Band members</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>I am Christine, the band major of my school’s band. In band, I have participated
in several exchange programs with other schools, allowing me to gain valuable
experience in playing pieces correctly and accurately. One of the most
memorable moments was performing during the Pope’s Mass. Although it was
my first time performing in front of such a large audience, it was an incredible
opportunity to collaborate with musicians from other schools and be part
of such a significant event.</p>
<p>Being in the band has taught me many important values. For example, I
learnt the importance of taking care of my instrument and bringing it home
for practice, as well as ensuring it is brought back on CCA days. Failing
to do so would mean missing out on practice, ultimately wasting valuable
time.
<br>~Christine Chua Ying Suan, class 4/5</p>
<p>Being in a band has been amazing! The friendships, love of music, and
excitement of playing for performances have been so rewarding. Practices
were tough, but they helped us get better and create something awesome.
Playing performances, from school concerts to the Singapore Youth Festival,
was electric. The crowd's energy and feeling connected with my bandmates
made memories which l always treasure. Every show was a lesson, making
us better and more confident. The good times were great, and the bad times
taught us a lot. It was more than just music; it was a journey of growth
and friendship.

<p>I’m Cen Ning from 3 George, and as a trumpet player in the AES Concert
Band, I love sharing my passion for music. Through events like band exchanges
and Festival Winds 2024, I’ve learned valuable skills, such as breath control
and shaping musical phrases, by collaborating with other bands. Concert
Band has also taught me dedication, perseverance and the joy of playing
together. Ultimately, being part of a small band is about quality, not
quantity, and our unity defines our success.
