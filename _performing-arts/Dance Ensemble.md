### About Us

AES Dance Ensemble (AESDE) is a team of dynamic individuals brought together by  our love for dance. 

In AESDE, we work together as a team by relying on each other’s strengths to pull ourselves up. Our CCA encourages a warm and welcoming environment, creating a  place that allows us to learn perseverance, determination and teamwork. We believe that it is alright to make mistakes as long as we try our best and learn from them. Together, we strive for excellence with our motto: “Don’t just dance, move the world.”
