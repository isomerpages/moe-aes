<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>AES Choir offers students a unique opportunity to explore and develop
their musical talents while fostering a sense of teamwork and artistic
expression. We aim to develop individuals with a passion for music through
singing and appreciation of different music forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the harmonious blending of voices, choir members create captivating
performances that inspire and uplift both themselves and their audiences.
Choir provides a platform for students to cultivate essential skills such
as discipline, collaboration, and self-confidence, all while deepening
their appreciation for music and culture. Whether itâ€™s singing in unison
or mastering complex harmonies, participating in a choir offers a fulfilling
and enriching experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional
academic pursuits.</p>
<h4>Student Opportunities</h4>

Youth Festival and international competition such as the Singapore International

like The Arts House and Tan Tock Seng Hospital as well as school performances
