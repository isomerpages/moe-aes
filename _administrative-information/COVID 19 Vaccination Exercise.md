Dear students  

  

Based on the recent MOE press release, starting from **1 Jun**, your parent (the primary person to contact) will receive a notification via the Parents’ Gateway and an SMS invitation for you to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Your parents may consult your family doctors for any medical concerns before booking your appointments.  You, being medically eligible to be vaccinated, are encouraged to book your appointments via the given link which is only valid for a specific period of time. 

  

Upon receiving the SMS invitation, your parents should book a vaccination slot in order to secure appointments on preferred dates before the slots are open to other groups. You are also encouraged to book your first dose of vaccination during this June vacation and the 2nd dose from 6 to 8 weeks later.
