Before your child/ward chooses his/her Secondary Three subject combination, please discuss with him/her and understand his/her interests, passion and aspirations. The choice of subject combination determines the subjects that students will be taking for the National Examinations, their future entry to courses offered by Post-Secondary Educational Institutions and their future career choices.

  

Subjects are offered based on academic merit (which includes overall performance and subject performance subject combinations), class size and based on school professional judgement.
