Dear Secondary One students, congratulations on your posting to AES!   
In light of the COVID-19 situation, students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools this year after receiving your posting results. For enhanced SMM, no parent is allowed into the school from 4 Jan 2022 onwards. Only one parent may accompany the child for the purchase of books/ uniform in December 2021. Please refer to this site for the information required.  
  
For general enquiries, please contact the school at **6572 9100** or email us at **aes@moe.edu.sg**.
