<p>As part of the commemoration of our <strong>70th Anniversary</strong> and
in conjunction with <strong>International Friendship Day</strong>, we are
excited to introduce the Asian Young Leaders for Human Fraternity (AYLHF)
- a youth impact initiative by AES.</p>
<p>The AYLHF is inspired by the Human Fraternity landmark document, launched
by Pope Francis and Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of al-Azhar in 2019. The
AYLHF aims to facilitate communication and connection among young leaders
in Asia, with the ultimate goal of promoting mutual respect and understanding,
regardless of race, language or religion.</p>
<p>As such, we are glad to have guests of 5 schools from 3 countries to join
us for this occasion.</p>
<p>Through the AYLHF platform, we hope to foster the development of strong
bonds and friendships among young leaders and promote the importance of
building human fraternity.</p>
<p>With that, we will be launching the AYLHF website officially 30th March
2023.</p>
