Dear students,

The attire for the whole school will adjust in Term 4. Please note that with effect from Term 4 Day 1 that in view of the current manageable weather, students will be required to wear FULL UNIFORM for all days, EXCEPT TUESDAY AND FRIDAY when they are able to report to school in their current half-uniform attire.
