In our effort to provide Assumptionknights with a holistic education, we would like Assumptionknights to gain a broad range of experiences and opportunities in developing skills and values that they will need in life.  

  

In Assumption English School, we believe in creating authentic learning experiences for our students. Our Internationalisation programme aims to provide overseas learning platforms to develop our students in the 21st Century through global awareness and cross-cultural skills.

  

We aim to provide every Assumptionknight with the opportunity to participate in at least one overseas learning programme by the end of their secondary school education in Assumption English School.

  

**Our outbound Cultural Exchange Programmes for Secondary 3 students are:-**

*   Cultural Exchange Programme with Montfort College, Chiangmai
*   Cultural Exchange Programme with Assumption College, Bangkok
*   Cultural Exchange Programme with Assumption College, Lampang
*   Cultural Exchange and Service Learning Programme in Vietnam
*   Cultural Exchange and Service Learning Programme in Cambodia

  

Thailand
--------

32 Secondary 3 students and 5 teachers participated in a Cultural and Immersion Programme to Thailand, Bangkok. Both teachers and students enjoyed themselves learning local sport, Muay Thai, as well as making local handicrafts. They also had the opportunity to join our friends from Assumption College, Bangkok for Thai Cooking Practices, Thai Classical Dance, Thai Musical Instruments (Ranad & Khim), Thai Puppets (Hun Krabok) and Making of Kra Thong.  
  
“Our Thai buddies are so generous and helpful! They helped us a lot during the trip when we visited their school during our second and third day. They were also very welcoming. Even though some of the students are not our buddies or not involved in the particular activity, they went the extra mile to help us when we were lost and were very friendly, making us feel comfortable. I would want our guests to feel the same way that I felt when they visit us next time.” - Cassiel Cheong 3/4
