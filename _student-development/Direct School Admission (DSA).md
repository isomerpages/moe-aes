<h4><strong><u>About DSA</u></strong></h4>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system,
via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic
and non-academic achievements and talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>School Vision</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Men and Women of Character and Learning, in the Service of God and Community.</p>
<p><strong><u>Selection Criteria</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Interest and Passion</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who demonstrate an interest or passion in pursuing the chosen
area may apply. All shortlisted applicants will have to submit a short
write-up (no more than 200 words) about their interest and passion of the
chosen DSA area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Demonstrated Potential and Aptitude&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basketball (Girls &amp; Boys), Floorball (Boys), Football (Boys) and Judo (Girls &amp; Boys)</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants should demonstrate sporting potential. This includes active
participation in sports. Relevant experience such as representing their
primary schools at the National School Games (NSG) level or representing
their sport clubs/academy at external competitions are considered but not
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Speaking &amp; Debates (Boys and Girls)</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants should demonstrate potential in Public Speaking and/or Debating.
Applicants with relevant experience in these areas and/or represented their
schools are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p><strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Youth Leadership (Boys and Girls)</strong>
</p>
<p>We invite applicants from students eager to develop as leaders and contribute
to the community. We are looking for individuals who demonstrate:</p>
<p>A strong passion of service and positive attitude towards helping their
peers, school and community, ideally supported by experience in volunteer
activities.</p>
<p>Good character, evidenced by a Conduct Grade of at least "Very Good" in
Primary 5 (overall) and Primary 6 (mid-year).</p>
<p>Leadership potential, shown through prior leadership roles in primary
school (e.g. Prefect, Chairperson, CCA Leader) and experience in planning
or organising school or community events (e.g. Teachers' Day, Values in
Action, Sport Day). Other forms of service to the community will also be
considered.</p>
<p>Do note that the Community Youth Leadership Programme at AES is not a
CCA and successful applicants are still expected to take up a CCA.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Skills Assessment/Trials</strong>
</p>
<p>Only shortlisted applicants will receive an invitation to attend a skills
assessment/trial which will include an evaluation on specific skills related
to the area applied for, as well as other attributes such as teamwork and
a growth mind-set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Interviews with School Key Personnel &amp; Teacher ICs</strong>
</p>
<p>The intent of the interview with school key personnel and teacher ICs
is to allow applicants an opportunity to share more about their interest
and passion on their chosen sport and will be arranged on the same say
as the trial.</p>
<p>All applications received will be acknowledged via email.</p>
<p><strong><u>Important Considerations</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Applicants who do not have prior experience may also apply. The school will assess applicants based on the selection criteria, which may include assessing the potential of the applicants.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Meeting all the above criteria does not guarantee the student will be shortlisted/given an offer.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</em>

<p>AES has put in place a good training and developmental programme to develop
the physical skills as well as character of our Judokas (Boys &amp; Girls).
Over the past years, we have nurtured and developed many outstanding Judokas
who have represented our Singapore Schools Team as well as Team Singapore
at the youth and national levels.</p>
<p>Our ‘B’ Boys’ and ‘B’ Girls’ Dvisions have emerged Top 3 positions in
the National School Games Judo Championships in 2022 and 2023. Our Judokas
have also performed consistently well in other affiliated competitions
organised by the Singapore Judo Federation.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AES Basketball programme aims to develop basketball players with the
necessary skills, from match strategies and teamwork to time management
skills, in order to excel as an athlete.</p>
<p>With character development as our focus, we stress on the following three
key values:</p>
<p>• Discipline – self-management in handling demands of academics and basketball</p>
<p>• Focus – winning mindset</p>
<p>• Diligence – the concerted and consistent effort put in into trainings
with values well-aligned to our school motto, Labor Omnia Vincit (Through
Work Achieve Success)</p>
<p>We subscribe to the ethos of ‘Making Every Basket Count’ to inspire our
players to turn every opportunity into an opportunity to shine.</p>
<p>Our teams have done consistently well to finish among the top 8 positions
in the West Zone National School Games (NSG) among over 40 other secondary
schools, as well as at the National level.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AES has been endorsed as one of the School Football Academy (SFA) schools.
This school-based academy is part of the Unleash The Roar! (UTR!) national
project which aims to unite Singaporeans through football and create more
opportunities for young Singaporeans to develop their talents.</p>
<p>As an SFA school, AES works closely with the Football Association of Singapore
(FAS) and Sport Singapore (SportSG) to provide a conducive daily training
environment to develop our footballers holistically. Our collaboration
with the FAS provides our footballers the opportunity to be exposed to
specialised training such as Goalkeeper Strength and Fitness as well as
Sports Science training,with an emphasis on character development.</p>
<p>AES Football boys’ teams compete actively at the National School Games
(NSG) competitions. This year, our ‘B’ Division Boys team competes in League
5 and ‘C’ Division Boys team competes in League 1. With a dedicated team
of 5 teacher facilitators overseeing the weekly training sessions, the
team adopts a developmental approach towards football development in our
players.</p>
<p>The Football programme at AES aims to instil in our players the following
outcomes:</p>
<p>• Good sportsmanship - AssumptionKnights who honour the rules of the game
and take pride in fair play;</p>
<p>• Strong football skills and techniques, teamwork; as well as</p>
<p>• Keen sense of focus, commitment and respect for the sport.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our aim:</strong> To develop floorballers in character, leadership
and sportsmanship through holistic programmes.</p>
<p>Adrenaline rush! Teamwork! Exhilarating! These are just some words to
describe floorball, an indoor hockey game that has drawn the attention
of many youths despite being a relatively new sport.</p>
<p>It is no surprise why floorball is so popular amongst youths. Simply,
it is a sport that is easy for anyone to pick up and play. The game is
played at a fast pace with lots of action and thrills for both players
and audience. It is a safe and versatile sport, which requires only lightweight
plastic sticks and a ball played at any open space, indoors or outdoors.</p>
<p>AES is one of the pioneers in bringing floorball into secondary schools.
AES Floorball has been an all-boys team since 2017 with the ultimate aim
of winning the National Schools Floorball Championships. If you are looking
for a fast-paced sport with lots of skills to develop you as a sportsperson
and opportunities to forge lasting friendships with your teammates, Floorball
is the CCA for you!</p>

<p>The SPEAK Programme provides ample opportunities for all students to develop
their speaking skills in an interactive and safe learning environment.
These include projects at each level to showcase their speaking skills.
Students who show a flair for speaking can showcase their talents in debating
and oratorical contests and given student emcee roles at school events
and programmes. We hope to continue building and enhancing students’ love
for the language through the wide array of programmes we have.</p>
