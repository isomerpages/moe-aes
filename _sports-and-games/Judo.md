### About Us

“Still your Mind, Crush a Mountain”

The AES Judo programme aims to instil in our Judokas the values of self-discipline and respect for others, as well as to develop mental and physical resilience, faster reflexes, better body coordination and concentration.&nbsp;

AES Judokas train 2-3 times weekly. Each CCA training is focused on physical conditioning, learning new Judo moves and practising safe break fall techniques, so that we may become more proficient in the sport in a safe manner. The team is mentored by main coach, Mohamad Faizal (SJF Director in Coaching and Education), and he is supported by assistant coach, Gu Jiayao, and 3 teachers-in-charge.
