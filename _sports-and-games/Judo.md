<h4><strong><u>Motto</u></strong>: </h4>
<p><strong><em>“Still your Mind, Crush a Mountain”</em></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong><u>About Us</u></strong></h4>
<p>The AES Judo programme is designed to inculcate in our Judokas the values
of self-discipline and respect for others, while also fostering the development
of mental and physical resilience, quicker reflexes, improved body coordination,
and enhanced concentration.</p>
<p>The AES Judokas engage in training sessions 2-3 times a week. Each CCA
training session is dedicated to physical conditioning, acquiring new Judo
techniques, and practising safe break fall methods, thereby enhancing proficiency
in the sport in a secure manner. The team is under the guidance of the
head coach, Azfar (Head Coach of School Of Judo), along with four teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p></p>
