<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The AES Judo programme is designed to inculcate in our Judokas the values
of self-discipline and respect for others, while also fostering the development
of mental and physical resilience, quicker reflexes, improved body coordination,
and enhanced concentration.</p>
<p>The AES Judokas engage in training sessions 2-3 times a week. Each CCA
training session is dedicated to physical conditioning, acquiring new Judo
techniques, and practising safe break fall methods, thereby enhancing proficiency
in the sport in a secure manner. The team is under the guidance of our
coach, Azfar (Head Coach of School Of Judo) and four teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>This year, we are delighted to announce the remarkable achievements of
AES Judokas in the following competitions:</p>

<p>Through consistent training and competition, our Judokas have developed
both their skills and confidence. Participation in grading events and friendly
matches has strengthened not only their technical abilities but also their
sense of teamwork and school pride. Over time, Judo has become more than
just a sport - it has fostered a strong sense of belonging. In this environment,
trust and camaraderie continue to grow, shaping not just athletes, but
a supportive community.</p>
