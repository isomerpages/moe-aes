### About Us

To a softball player, nothing can quite match the thrill of clinching a solid hit, or the excitement of stopping a drive rushing at you as fast as a car. But apart from the desire for an adrenaline rush, our softball girls also need the courage to stand their ground, the determination to train for hours in the sweltering heat, and the heart to work closely with each of their teammates.

With competitions and activities back in full force this year, the AES Rangers were able to take to the field and play against rivals from other schools. After months of gruelling training, the girls were able to test their mettle on the pitch, and were not found wanting. With the grit and tenacity they showed in each of their games, the AES Rangers were able to come back to school with their heads held high.  

The AES Rangers are thankful for the constant support from one another, their parents,  teachers and coach, and look forward to more fun and friendship both on and off the field.
