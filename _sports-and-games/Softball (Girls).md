Softball is a sport that requires team effort but is also a personal journey of self-discovery whereby students learn the importance of passion, appreciate the value of a growth mindset, and embrace the challenges of leadership and collaboration. As softball players, students learn valuable lessons that are not just important in the game, but also beyond the softball field.

  

Persistence and resilience are other key learning outcomes for the team. The duration of the game is long and the players have to leverage on each other's strengths and cheer each other on. Likewise, as a team sport, commitment to the team and working together towards a common goal are the foundation for victory.&nbsp;

  

Hence, the team needs to ensure that they are always ready to endure the sacrifices on the field that will help them play better as a collective group. Through the long hours of training, as well as the hardships and challenges that are part of the softball journey, the team gets stronger with each game and the friendships forged in the CCA will be cherished by many graduates of the CCA for years to come.

  

Come and join the AES Rangers to experience and learn about the sport!
