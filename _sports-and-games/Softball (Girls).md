<p>For a softball player, few things match the rush of making solid contact
with the bat or fielding a fast, driven ball. Beyond the action and adrenaline,
our AES Rangers know that the sport demands something deeper: <strong><em>Courage, Discipline, and strong team spirit</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Training under the hot sun, pushing past limits and showing up for one
another have become second nature to the team. With competitions in full
swing, our players had the opportunity to put their hard work into action,
taking to the field against schools across the island.</p>

<p>No matter the outcome of each match, the Rangers continue to grow in skill
and resilience. They are grateful for the unwavering support of their teammates,
families, teachers, and coach, who stand with them through every pitch
and play.</p>
