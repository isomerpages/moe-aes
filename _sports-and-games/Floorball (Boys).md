### About Us
Adrenaline rush! Teamwork! Exhilarating!

These are just some words to describe floorball, an indoor hockey game that has drawn the attention of many youths despite being a relatively new sport.

It is no surprise why floorball is so popular amongst youths. Simply, it is a sport that is easy for anyone to pick up and play. The game is played at a fast pace with lots of action and thrills for both players and audience. It is a safe and versatile sport, which requires only lightweight plastic sticks and a ball played at any open space, indoors or outdoors.

AES is one of the pioneers in bringing floorball into secondary schools. AES Floorball has been an all-boys team since 2017 with the ultimate aim of winning the National Schools Floorball Championships. If you are looking for a fast-paced sport with lots of skills to develop you as a sportsperson and opportunities to forge lasting friendships with your teammates, Floorball is the CCA for you!
