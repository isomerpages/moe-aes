Assumption Basketball aims to develop our students’ interest, passion and potential in the sport through tightly-knitted character and values education. Our team of teachers and coaches aim to develop our students to be stronger individuals both physically and mentally through the rigour of our training processes. We seek to develop and strengthen students’ mastery of skills to challenge for the highest accolades, and in the process instilling discipline and sense of team spirit and sportsmanship in our students, preparing them to face future challenges in their endeavours.

2019 is the year when AES Basketball welcomed our first DSA student, Raphael, a secondary one student who was part of our team that managed to proceed to the 2nd Round of the West Zone Championship of the National School Games. Our ‘C’ boys narrowly missed out on the National Championship. They held traditional powerhouse Jurong Secondary School to a draw at full time but was not able to overcome the stronger opponent in extra time. Earlier in Term 1, our ‘B’ boys also played Jurong Secondary in the second round and triumphed over the opponent.

  

For both our ‘B’ and ‘C’ girls, they participated in their West Zone Championship that saw them gain valuable experience in the process.

  

During the June holidays, the ‘C’ boys and girls participated in an external basketball tournament, T-net, where both teams came in 3rd Runner-up and won bronze medals in their respective level of competition.

A special mention this year is that we have once again produced a National athlete! Following Amirul Miran who represented Assumption in the Singapore Schools ASEAN School Games (ASG) in 2018, this year, our ‘B’ boys Captain Mentor, Peter Paul Obatay, was selected by Singapore Schools and played for the Singapore Under-18 basketball team at the ASG held at Indonesia in July this year. To put things into perspective, only 12 basketballers in this age group were selected nation-wide. We are very proud of Peter and Amirul.

  

As we embark on the 2nd year of the DSA journey and from many more DSA trials, we are hopeful that more of them would join our AES Basketball family in 2020.

This year also see Assumption Basketball organised our inaugural AES 5-a-side Basketball Challenge for the neighbouring primary schools in late May. This was with a view to introduce our school to the primary school pupils and to attract potential DSA applicants.
