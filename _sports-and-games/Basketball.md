### About Us

The AES Basketball programme aims to develop basketball players who are honed with the necessary skills, from match strategies and teamwork to time management skills, in order to excel as an athlete. 

With character development as our focus, we stress on the following three key values:
Discipline – self-management in handling demands of academics and basketball 
Focus – winning mindset
Diligence – the concerted and consistent effort put in into trainings with values well-aligned to our school motto, Labor Omnia Vincit (Through Work Achieve Success)

We subscribe to the ethos of ‘Making Every Basket Count’ to inspire our players to turn every opportunity into an opportunity to shine. The team also follows the philosophy “When training is tough, competition will be easy.” 

Our teams have done consistently well to finish among the top 8 positions in the West Zone National School Games (NSG) among over 40 other secondary schools, as well as at the National level.
