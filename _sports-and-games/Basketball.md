<p>Both our boys and girlsâ€™ teams have done consistently well to finish among
the top 8 positions in the West Zone National School Games (NSG) among
over 40 other secondary schools, as well as at the National level. On top
of the usual National School Games, the school also aims to provide more
opportunities for our students to develop their talent via friendly matches
or engaging in outreach activities where we work with primary schools to
provide guidance to the primary school students.</p>
<h4>Training Days and Timing</h4>
<p>AES Basketball Team trains 2 to 3 times a week.</p>
