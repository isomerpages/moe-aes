### About Us

Assumption English School (AES) has been endorsed as one of the School Football Academy (SFA) schools. This school-based academy is part of the Unleash The Roar! (UTR!) national project which aims to unite Singaporeans through football. As an SFA, AES works closely with the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and Sport Singapore (SportSG) to provide a conducive daily training environment to develop our footballers holistically. The SFA aims to provide a training environment with high quality coaching, led by our Spanish Head Coach Mr Angel, assistant coaches Mr Ismail and Mr Justin, complemented by using the sports science and technology approach and with an emphasis on character development. 

Our collaboration with FAS provides our footballers the opportunity to be exposed to specialised training such as Goalkeeper Strength and Fitness as well as Sports Science training. The Football programme at AES aims to instil in our players the following outcomes:

*   Good sportsmanship, AssumptionKnights who will honour the rules of the game and take pride in fair play;
    
*   Strong football skills and techniques, teamwork; 
    
*   Keen sense of focus, commitment and respect for the sport.
