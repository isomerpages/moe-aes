<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>Assumption English School (AES) has been endorsed as one of the School
Football Academy (SFA) schools. This school-based academy is part of the
Unleash The Roar! (UTR!) national project which aims to unite Singaporeans
through football. As an SFA, AES works closely with the Football Association
of Singapore (FAS) and Sport Singapore (SportSG) to provide a conducive
daily training environment to develop our footballers holistically. The
SFA aims to provide a training environment with high quality coaching,
led by our Head Coach Mr Sevki, assistant coaches Mr Ismadi and Mr Fabian,
complemented by using the sports science and technology approach and with
an emphasis on character development.</p>
<p>The weekly afternoon training sessions for both ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions
are on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; an hour and a half each.</p>
<p>Our collaboration with FAS provides our footballers the opportunity to
be exposed to specialised training such as Goalkeeper Strength and Fitness
as well as Sports Science training. The Football programme at AES aims
to instil in our players the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Good sportsmanship, AssumptionKnights who will honour the rules of the
game and take pride in fair play;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong football skills and techniques, teamwork; as well as</p>
</li>
<li>
