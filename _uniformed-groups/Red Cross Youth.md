### About Us

“Seldom seen but ever-present” – this remains the unofficial motto of the Red Cross Youth (RCY) Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) as we continue to quietly serve the school and the community.

We attend to trips, falls, cuts, abrasions, and bruises. However, our service is not limited to just providing first aid bandaging; we also extend psychological support. Red Cross cadets work to ensure that the injured are at ease and comfortable, offering words of comfort like, “There is nothing to worry about; all will be well.” Our goal is for our cadets to learn the values of selfless service, compassion, and humility. These are the qualities that would nurture ‘men and women of character’ - our AES vision.

This year, we not only resumed activities like visiting the blood bank and inviting Red Cross Academy instructors to conduct Basic First Aid training for our cadets but also had the privilege of sending all Secondary 1 and Secondary 4 cadets to participate in the World Red Cross Day celebration organised by the Red Cross HQ. 

In everything we undertake, we strive to live out the Red Cross Youth motto: “Humanity in our hands”.
