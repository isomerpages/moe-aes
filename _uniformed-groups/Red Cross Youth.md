<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>“Seldom seen but ever-present” – this remains the unofficial motto of
the Red Cross Youth (RCY) Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) as we continue to
serve the school and community quietly.</p>
<p>We attend to trips, falls, cuts, abrasions, and bruises. However, our
service extends beyond just providing first aid and bandaging; we also
offer psychological support. Red Cross cadets work to ensure that the injured
are at ease and comfortable, offering words of comfort such as, “There
is nothing to worry about; all will be well.” Our goal is for our cadets
to learn the values of selfless service, compassion, and humility. These
are the qualities that nurture ‘men and women of character’ – our AES vision.</p>
<p>In 2025, we engaged in activities such as visiting the blood bank and
inviting instructors from the Red Cross Academy to conduct Basic First
Aid training for our cadets. We also had the privilege of sending all Secondary
1 and Secondary 4 cadets to participate in the World Red Cross Day celebration
organised by Red Cross HQ.</p>
<p>In everything we undertake, we strive to live out the Red Cross Youth
motto: “Humanity in our hands”.</p>
