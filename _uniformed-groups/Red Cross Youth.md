### About Us

“Seldom seen but ever-present” – this remains the unofficial motto of the Red Cross Youth (RCY) Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) as we continue to serve the school and community quietly.

We attend to trips, falls, cuts, abrasions, and bruises. However, our service extends beyond just providing first aid and bandaging; we also offer psychological support. Red Cross cadets work to ensure that the injured are at ease and comfortable, offering words of comfort such as, “There is nothing to worry about; all will be well.” Our goal is for our cadets to learn the values of selfless service, compassion, and humility. These are the qualities that nurture 'men and women of character' – our AES vision.

In 2023, after the pandemic, we not only resumed activities such as visiting the blood bank and inviting instructors from the Red Cross Academy to conduct Basic First Aid training for our cadets, but we also had the privilege of sending all Secondary 1 and Secondary 4 cadets to participate in the World Red Cross Day celebration organised by Red Cross HQ.

In everything we undertake, we strive to live out the Red Cross Youth motto: “Humanity in our hands”.
