### About Us

  

“Seldom seen but ever present” – this is the unofficial motto of the Red Cross Youth CCA as we continue to quietly serve the school and the community.

  

We serve the school and the community diligently, among the activities we have participated in are: serving the nation by being in the public patrolling contingent during National Day, serving the community by promoting Blood Donation drives, participating in the annual Red Cross Flag Day, visiting the sometimes forgotten when we go to the Red Cross Home for the Disabled.

  

These things we do as a matter of course, as a matter of service, but the true ethos of the Red Cross CCA can be seen when we serve within the school – there is nothing more satisfying and humbling than serving your fellow schoolmate in time of need. Here, the unit has been on active duty at every major school event such as Sports Day, Cross Country Run or even when the school hosts other schools for sporting events. We are also there, watching from the side-lines, at minor school events e.g. a soccer match. The trips, falls, cuts, abrasions, bruises are all tended to by us, but we do not merely provide the first aid bandaging but the psychological support as well when Red Cross cadets put the injured at ease, to make them comfortable as they are tended to – to tell them, “There is nothing to worry about, all will be well”. These are the things we want our cadets to learn: to serve freely, to show compassion, to be humble. All the qualities that make “men and women of character” – and this is what the Red Cross Youth CCA truly does.

  

We aspire to live up to our Red Cross Youth motto, “Humanity in our hands”.
