### About Us


AES National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) engages their cadets in a stringent but enjoyable programme every year. The key thrusts of the Unitâ€™s training framework are character and leadership development. Cadets will be able to develop values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness through their involvement in the various NPCC activities in store for them.

NPCC cadets have had a fulfilling and enriching CCA experience. It was marked by significant events such as the Combined UG Camp as well as the Handover of Leadership for CCA Ceremony. The cadets also participated actively in HQ-organised activities/ competitions (National Police Day Parade, Inter Unit Crime Scene Investigation Competition, Classification Shoot, .22 Shooting Revolver Competition, Area 18 Camp, etc) and had the opportunity to interact and network with cadets from other NPCC units.

May the unit continue to grow from strength to strength!
