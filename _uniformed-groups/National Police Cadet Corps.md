### Vision

To become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.  

  

### Mission

To develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.  

  

### Motto

Towards Excellence  

  

### About Us

AES National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) engages their cadets in a stringent but enjoyable programme every year. As the only uniformed youth organisation to enjoy close affiliation with the Singapore Police Force, their cadets are exposed to the unique opportunities to gain exposure and familiarity with Singapore’s crime prevention efforts to build a Safe and Secure Home. The key thrusts of the Unit’s training framework are character and leadership development. Cadets will be able to develop values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness through their involvement in the various NPCC activities in store for them.&nbsp;

  

### Key Programmes  

With a drive to maintain the prestigious Gold UOPA Award, the cadets continued living up to the unit’s motto of “Towards Excellence” and embarked on the year’s various programmes with high level of enthusiasm, commitment, duty, service and performance. The activities participated by the cadets include the 0.22 Revolver Live Shoot, NPCC Swearing-In Ceremony, Area Games Day, NPCC Annual Parade, Adventure and Survival Training Camps at Pulau Ubin, Kayaking enrichment activity and Inter-Unit Campcraft Competition. Cadets also attended Police Procedures, Basic Law, Road Safety Training, Homefront Security, Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) as well as Anti-Narcotics courses.

  

As part of the mission to develop responsible and civic-minded individuals, cadets also embarked on yearly Values in Actions projects in partnership with the Singapore Police Force such as the Community Safety and Security Programme (CSSP) and Police Youth Ambassador (PYA) projects.&nbsp; This year, the Secondary 2 and 3 cadets did a CSSP project in collaboration with the Bukit Panjang Neighbourhood Police Centre to raise awareness among the school community and residents of Bukit Panjang on online purchase scams, road safety and SGSecure movement.
