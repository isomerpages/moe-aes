<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>AES National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) engages their cadets in a stringent
but enjoyable programme every year. The key thrusts of the Unitâ€™s training
framework are character and leadership development. Cadets will be able
to develop values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness,
tenacity and civic-consciousness through their involvement in the various
NPCC activities in store for them.</p>
<p>NPCC cadets have had a fulfilling and enriching CCA experience. It was
marked by significant events such as the Combined UG Camp as well as the
Handover of Leadership for CCA Ceremony. The cadets also participated actively
in HQ-organised activities/ competitions (National Police Day Parade, Inter
Unit Crime Scene Investigation Competition, Classification Shoot, .22 Shooting
Revolver Competition, Area 18 Camp, etc) and had the opportunity to interact
and network with cadets from other NPCC units.</p>
<p>May the unit continue to grow from strength to strength!</p>
