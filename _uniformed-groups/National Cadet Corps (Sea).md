<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>The AES National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Sea) is proud to be one of 15 sea
units in Singapore, operating in close partnership with the Republic of
Singapore Navy (RSN). As part of this elite group, our cadets benefit from
unique learning opportunities and direct engagement with RSN personnel,
gaining valuable insights into maritime defence and leadership.</p>
<p>Each year, NCC Headquarters organises a series of milestone programmes
that combine military-related training with engaging sea-based activities.
These are thoughtfully designed for cadets at various stages of their development,
with the goal of nurturing confident, resilient, and committed youth leaders.</p>
