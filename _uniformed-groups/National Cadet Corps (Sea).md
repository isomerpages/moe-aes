### About Us

AES National Cadet Corp (SEA) is one of the 16 sea units in Singapore which is supported by the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). As a member of the NCC (SEA), our cadets have the opportunity to learn from the best and gain valuable insights from servicemen of the Republic of Singapore Navy.

Every year, HQ organises key milestone programmes for each level that aims to develop them into extraordinary youth leaders. The Junior Cadets attended Camp FORGE, which aims to instill core values and self-discipline as well as to build their character and confidence. The Senior Cadets went for Camp STEEL and they developed strong bonds among themselves and the activities prepared them to become responsible and confident leaders. The Cadet Leaders attended the Sea Specialist Programme. This programme helps to enhance the cadetsâ€™ seamanship knowledge and raise their awareness of RSN and maritime knowledge.

NCC HQ also organised water-based activities such as the Sea Challenge, Mini-Kayaking Expedition and Dragon Boat Competition.&nbsp;

Through engagement in different activities, AES NCC Sea will continue to provide cadets with the opportunity to grow and become dependable men.

To serve with pride and dedication, NCC!
