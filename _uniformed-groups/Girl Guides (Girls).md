### About Us:


AES Girl Guides 1st COY is part of the international Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting Movement. We offer opportunities for girls to get involved in local and international communities, equipping them to make a lasting positive impact by helping others.

  
As Guides, they live by the motto “Be Prepared” which means they will be ready to cope with anything that comes their way. During their CCA sessions, we empower the girls through fun and challenging programmes and unique experiences, adventures and activities. We aim to build girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.  
  

The girls develop a deep sense of confidence and self-assurance, along with vital leadership and life skills – all while learning through fun adventures and making lifelong friendships!

  

AES Girl Guides participated in various events, such as World Thinking Day, National Day Parade, West Division Day and many more. During these events, they made friends with Guides from other schools and created fun memories together.
