<h4><strong>What do we do in AES:</strong></h4>
<p>In AES, the Girl Guides focus on developing skills and values that empower
them to serve their community and make a positive impact. Key activities
include World Thinking Day, West Division Fest, and West Division Campfire.
We also collaborate with other Uniformed Groups (UG) in AES to organise
events such as a combined UG camp, Passing-out Parade (POP), and the National
Day Parade.</p>

<p>Our weekly activities include outdoor cooking, learning essential outdoor
skills like knot-tying, and earning various badges such as [First Aid,
Dance, Sewing]. These activities help strengthen bonds, build life skills,
enhance leadership, and promote teamwork and discipline.</p>
